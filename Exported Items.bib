  abstract = {Significance             Blooms of phytoplankton can shift the ecosystem state of low-nutrient ocean regions between net heterotrophic and autotrophic conditions, increasing carbon sequestration and driving carbon export to the deep sea. Little is known about the traits that govern the timing and magnitude of these bloom events. We used metatranscriptomics to assess phytoplankton functional group-specific metabolic shifts experimentally during simulated blooms in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The results indicate blooms form when phytoplankton are released from limitation by resources (nutrients, vitamins, and trace metals) and that the mechanistic basis for the success of one functional group over another may be driven by how efficiently the transcriptome is modulated following a nutrient pulse.           ,              A diverse microbial assemblage in the ocean is responsible for nearly half of global primary production. It has been hypothesized and experimentally demonstrated that nutrient loading can stimulate blooms of large eukaryotic phytoplankton in oligotrophic systems. Although central to balancing biogeochemical models, knowledge of the metabolic traits that govern the dynamics of these bloom-forming phytoplankton is limited. We used eukaryotic metatranscriptomic techniques to identify the metabolic basis of functional group-specific traits that may drive the shift between net heterotrophy and autotrophy in the oligotrophic ocean. Replicated blooms were simulated by deep seawater (DSW) addition to mimic nutrient loading in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, and the transcriptional responses of phytoplankton functional groups were assayed. Responses of the diatom, haptophyte, and dinoflagellate functional groups in simulated blooms were unique, with diatoms and haptophytes significantly (95\% confidence) shifting their quantitative metabolic fingerprint from the in situ condition, whereas dinoflagellates showed little response. Significantly differentially abundant genes identified the importance of colimitation by nutrients, metals, and vitamins in eukaryotic phytoplankton metabolism and bloom formation in this system. The variable transcript allocation ratio, used to quantify transcript reallocation following DSW amendment, differed for diatoms and haptophytes, reflecting the long-standing paradigm of phytoplankton r- and K-type growth strategies. Although the underlying metabolic potential of the large eukaryotic phytoplankton was consistently present, the lack of a bloom during the study period suggests a crucial dependence on physical and biogeochemical forcing, which are susceptible to alteration with changing climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F -ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P -values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

As much of marine primary productivity is processed by heterotrophic microbes, the substrate specificities of extracellular enzymes, the rates at which they function in seawater and sediments, and factors controlling their production, distribution, and active lifetimes, are central to carbon cycling in marine systems. In this review, these topics are considered from biochemical, microbial/molecular biological, and geochemical perspectives. Our understanding of the capabilities and limitations of heterotrophic microbial communities has been greatly advanced in recent years, in part through genetic and genomic approaches. New methods to measure enzyme activities in the field are needed to keep pace with these advances and to pursue intriguing evidence that patterns of enzyme activities in different environments are linked to differences in microbial community composition that may profoundly affect the marine carbon cycle.},

Until recently, however, our knowledge of marine polysaccharides was limited due to their great structural complexity, the correspondingly complicated enzymatic machinery used by microbial communities to degrade them, and a lack of readily applied means to isolate andcharacterize polysaccharides in detail. Advances in carbohydrate chemistry, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, and microbiology have led to new insights into the structures of polysaccharides, the means by which they are degraded by bacteria, and the ecology of polysaccharide production and decomposition. Here, we survey current knowledge, discuss recent advances, and present a new conceptual model linking polysaccharide structural complexity and abundance to microbially driven mechanisms of polysaccharide processing. We conclude by highlighting specific future research foci that will shed light on this central but poorly characterized component of the marine carbon cycle.},

The rate of uptake of [8-               14               C]guanosine by suspension-cultured               Catharanthus roseus               cells was more than 20 times higher than that of [8-               14               C]guanine. The rate of uptake of [8-               14               C]guanosine increased with the age of the culture. Pulse-chase experiments with [8-               14               C]guanosine revealed that some of the guanosine that had been taken up by the cells was converted to guanine nucleotides and incorporated into nucleic acids. A significant amount of [8-               14               C]guanosine was degraded directly to xanthine, allantoin and allantoic acid, with the generation of               14               CO               2               as the final product. The rate of salvage of [8-               14               C]guanosine for the synthesis of nucleic acids was highest in young cells, while the rate of degradation increased with the age of the cells. In segments of roots from               Vigna mungo               seedlings, nearly 50\% of the [8-               14               C]guanosine that had been absorbed over the course of 15 min was recovered in guanine nucleotides. A significant amount of the radioactivity in nucleotides became associated with nucleic acids and ureides during `chase' periods. In segments of young leaves of               Camellia sinensis               , [8-               14               C]guanosine was initially incorporated into guanine nucleotides, nucleic acids, theobromine and ureides, and the radioactivity in these compounds was transferred to caffeine and CO               2               during a 24-h incubation. Our results suggest that guanosine is an intermediate in the catabolism of guanine nucleotides and that it is re-utilised for nucleotide synthesis by `salvage' reactions. Guanosine was catabolised by the conventional degradation pathway via xanthine and allantoin. In some plants, guanosine is also utilised for the formation of ureide or the biosynthesis of caffeine.},

  abstract = {The evolution of data exchange in Mass Spectrometry spans decades and has ranged from human-readable text files representing individual scans or collections thereof (McDonald et al., 2004) through the official standard XML-based (Harold, Means, \& Udemadu, 2005) data interchange standard (Deutsch, 2012), to increasingly compressed (Teleman et al., 2014) variants of this standard sometimes requiring purely binary adjunct files (R{\"o}mpp et al., 2011). While the desire to maintain even partial human readability is understandable, the inherent mismatch between XML's textual and irregular format relative to the numeric and highly regular nature of actual spectral data, along with the explosive growth in dataset scales and the resulting need for efficient (binary and indexed) access has led to a phenomenon referred to as ``technical drift'' (Davis, 2013). While the drift is being continuously corrected using adjunct formats, compression schemes, and programs (R{\"o}st et al., 2015), we propose that the future of Mass Spectrometry Exchange Formats lies in the continued reliance and development of the PSI-MS (Mayer et al., 2014) controlled vocabulary, along with an expedited shift to an alternative, thriving and well-supported ecosystem for scientific data-exchange, storage, and access in binary form, namely that of HDF5 (Koranne, 2011). Indeed, pioneering efforts to leverage this universal, binary, and hierarchical data-format have already been published (Wilhelm et al., 2012; R{\"u}bel et al., 2013) though they have under-utilized self-description, a key property shared by HDF5 and XML. We demonstrate that a straightforward usage of plain (``vanilla'') HDF5 yields immediate returns including, but not limited to, highly efficient data access, platform independent data viewers, a variety of libraries (Collette, 2014) for data retrieval and manipulation in many programming languages and remote data access through comprehensive RESTful data-servers. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {A new `shape-orientated' continuous wavelet transform (CWT)-based algorithm employing an adapted Marr wavelet (AMW) with a shape matching index (SMI), defined as peak height normalized wavelet coefficient (C{$\prime$}max/H) for feature filtering, was developed for chromatographic peak detection and quantification. Exploiting the chromatographic profile of a candidate peak, AMW-SMI algorithm emphasizes more on the matching of the overall chromatographic profile to a reference Gaussian shape, while partly alleviates the requirement on the signal intensity derived from single or several data points, thus it allows the detection of low-intensity features from metabolites at low abundance. AMW-SMI imposes maximum and minimum thresholds on the ridgeline width and length to define a valid ridgeline, which corresponds to a more stably shaped chromatographic profile. The maximum wavelet coefficient Cmax{$\prime$}(a0,b0) on the valid ridgeline determines the translation b0 as the peak center. AMW-SMI detects the valley lines to define the peak boundaries, which is important to obtain accurate peak quantification. As a more `shape-orientated' peak detection algorithm, various methods related to the `shape' are introduced for feature filtering, out of which, the effective SNR (eSNR) is defined to evaluate if the shape is strong or good enough relative to the `shape noise', and the SMI, which can quantitatively evaluate the shape quality regardless of the data intensities and peak width, is applied to filter out the poorly shaped false positives. AMW-SMI performs Gaussian fitting of all data points between the defined peak boundaries to refine the peak parameters, and the refined SMI, SNR and peak width can be applied for further feature filtering and reinforce the `shape-quality' of final selected peaks. The performance of AMW-SMI is evaluated qualitatively (by recall, precision and F-score) and quantitatively (by ratio of isotopic features and triplicate RSD) on the LC-MS data of model mixtures of 21 human metabolite standards and 8 plant metabolite standards, and of serum sample spiked with the 21 human metabolite standards, and on the triplicate LC-MS data of the same sample of cell metabolomic extracts. Compared with XCMS (centWave) and MZmine 2 (ADAP), the proposed AMW-SMI algorithm can faithfully identify chromatographic peaks with significantly fewer false positives and demonstrated general superiority in terms of qualitative precision (robustness) and quantitative accuracy (by ratio of isotopic features), and comparable recall (sensitivity) and quantitative stability (by RSD of triplicate measurements).},

Previous studies mainly focused on nucleic acids and proteins, while lipids and metabolites were largely neglected. Noticeably, many of those micromolecules exhibited a high abundance in EVs. Revealing the metabolomics and lipidomics of EVs would provide more comprehensive information for biomarker discovery. With the rapid development of mass spectrometry (MS) facilities, MS-based micromolecule detection has become an emerging technique for EVs studies. Increasing evidence demonstrated the presence of EV-associated metabolites and lipids in different types of samples (e.g., cell, urine, serum, stool), which exhibited promising performance in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment responses. This review aims to summarize advances in micromolecule profiling of EVs for cancer biomarker discovery, with an emphasis on MS-based metabolomic and lipidomic analytical techniques. Challenges in this field, including the minimum sample quantity, normalization methods, and compound identifications, are also discussed along with possible solutions.},

The selected LC approach, hydrophilic interaction chromatography with an amino column, effectively separates highly water soluble metabolites that fail to retain using standard reversed-phase chromatography. MS/MS detection is achieved by scanning through numerous selected reaction monitoring events on a triple quadrupole instrument.

Potentially, microalgae can satisfy many global demands, but in large-scale cultivation the average productivity of most industrial strains is lower than maximal theoretical estimations, mainly due to sub-optimal growth conditions. Although microalgae have developed complex strategies to cope with environmental stresses, cultivation in outdoor photobioreactors is limited to few species and it is not yet sufficiently remunerative. Indeed, most microalgal species are very sensitive to environmental conditions, and changes in solar irradiation, temperature, and medium composition can drastically decrease biomass yield. Developing new strategies for improving algal tolerance to stress conditions is thus greatly desirable. One of the first responses that occur in both higher plants and microorganisms following the exposure to abiotic stress conditions, is an increased synthesis and accumulation of the amino acid proline. While the role of proline accumulation in stress adaptation is well-recognized in higher plants, in microalgae the implication of proline in stress tolerance still awaits full elucidation. In this review we summarize available data on proline metabolism under environmental stress in eukaryotic microalgae. Possible implications toward optimization of algal growth for biotechnological purposes are also discussed.},

SSH not only reflects the dynamics of the surface layer, but also is sensitive to the fluctuations of the main pycnocline; thus it is linked to events of nutrient upwelling. Beyond episodic upwelling events, it is not clear if and how SSH is linked to broader changes in the biogeochemical state of marine ecosystems. Our analysis of 23 years of satellite observations and biogeochemical measurements from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre shows that SSH is associated with numerous biogeochemical changes in distinct layers of the water column. From the sea surface to the depth of the chlorophyll maximum, dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen enigmatically increase with SSH, enhancing the abundance of heterotrophic picoplankton. At the deep chlorophyll maximum, increases in SSH are associated with decreases in vertical gradients of inorganic nutrients, decreases in the abundance of eukaryotic phytoplankton, and increases in the abundance of prokaryotic phytoplankton. In waters below {$\sim$}100 m depth, increases in SSH are associated with increases in organic matter and decreases in inorganic nutrients, consistent with predicted consequences of the vertical displacement of isopycnal layers. Our analysis highlights how satellite measurements of SSH can be used to infer the ecological and biogeochemical state of open-ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Abstract We examined the biogeochemical impact of paired mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones in spatial proximity ({$<$}200 km apart) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. While previous studies have demonstrated that upwelling associated with the intensification of cyclonic eddies can supply nutrients supporting plankton productivity, we observed that steeper vertical gradients in inorganic nutrients increased nutrient fluxes due to diapycnal mixing during the mature stage of cyclonic eddies. The increased diapycnal nutrient supply was linked with expansion of eukaryotic phytoplankton biomass and intensification of the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. This perturbation in the plankton community was associated with increased fluxes of biominerals (specifically particulate inorganic carbon and particulate silica) and isotopically enriched organic nitrogen in particles exported in the cyclone. The time-integrated effects of thermocline vertical displacements on the lower euphotic zone were predictable deficits and surpluses of inorganic nutrients and dissolved oxygen, respectively. However, the stoichiometry of oxygen and inorganic nutrients differed from that predicted for production and consumption of phytoplankton biomass, requiring additional biological processes that decouple changes in oxygen and nutrient concentrations. The dynamics revealed by this study may be a common feature of oligotrophic ecosystems, where mesoscale biogeochemical perturbations are buffered by the DCM layer, which limits the ecological impact of eddies in the well-lit, near-surface ocean. , Key Points The steepness of the nutricline in mature mesoscale eddies is an important driver of variability in pelagic ecosystems Differences in eukaryotic phytoplankton communities alter the export of particulate inorganic carbon and particulate silica across eddies Relative changes in oxygen and nutrients linked to displacements of the thermocline reflect anomalous cycling of organic matter},

Changes in the biochemical composition of phytoplankton communities over diel light cycles and attendant consequences for carbon and energy flux in environments remain poorly elucidated. Here we use lipidomic data from the North Pacific subtropical gyre to show that biosynthesis of energy-rich triacylglycerols (TAGs) by eukaryotic nanophytoplankton during the day and their subsequent consumption at night drives a large and previously uncharacterized daily carbon cycle. Diel oscillations in TAG concentration comprise 23\,{\textpm}\,11\% of primary production by eukaryotic nanophytoplankton representing a global flux of about 2.4 Pg C yr               -1               . Metatranscriptomic analyses of genes required for TAG biosynthesis indicate that haptophytes and dinoflagellates are active members in TAG production.

Eddy primary production, community biomass, and size composition were markedly enhanced but had little effect on the carbon export ratio. Instead, the system functioned as a selective silica pump. Strong trophic coupling and inefficient organic export may be general characteristics of community perturbation responses in the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses --- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Most of this carbon resides in dissolved molecules of varying bioavailability and reactivity, and aspects of the cycling of this carbon remain an enigma. The size-reactivity continuum model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the mechanisms governing the formation and mineralization of this carbon. In the seawater bioassay experiments that served as the original basis for this model, investigators observed that larger size classes of organic matter were more bioavailable and more rapidly remineralized by microbes than were smaller size classes. Studies of the chemical composition and radiocarbon content of marine organic matter have further indicated that the complexity and age of organic matter increase with decreasing molecular size. Biodegradation processes appear to shape the size distribution of organic matter and the nature of the small dissolved molecules that persist in the ocean.},

We present comparative lipidomes from communities entrained in two eddies of opposite polarities (cyclone--anticyclone) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). A previous work on this two-eddy system has shown differences in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) and biogenic silica sinking fluxes between the two eddies despite comparable total organic carbon fluxes. We measured the striking differences between the lipidomes of suspended and sinking particles that indicate taxon-specific responses to mesoscale perturbations. Specifically, cyanobacteria did not appear to respond to increased concentrations of phosphorus in the subsurface of the cyclonic eddy, while eukaryotic microbes exhibit P-stress relief as reflected in their lipid signatures. Furthermore, we found that two classes of lipids drive differences between suspended and sinking material: sinking particles are comparatively enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC, a membrane-associated lipid) and triacylglycerol (TAG, an energy storage lipid). We observed significantly greater export of TAGs from the cyclonic eddy as compared to the anticyclone and found that this flux is strongly correlated with the concentration of ballast minerals (PIC and biogenic silica). This increased export of TAGs from the cyclone, but not the anticyclone, suggests that cyclonic eddy perturbations may be a mechanism for the delivery of energy-rich organic material below the euphotic zone.},

Yet, their strategies in the acquisition and the partitioning of organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) are poorly described. Here, we measured at the single-cell level the uptake of dissolved inorganic C (C-fixation), C-leucine, N-leucine, nitrate (NO               3               -               ), ammonium (NH               4               +               ), and N-urea in pigmented and nonpigmented picoplankton groups at six low-N stations in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Our study highlights important differences in trophic strategies between               Prochlorococcus               ,               Synechococcus               , photosynthetic pico-eukaryotes, and nonpigmented prokaryotes.

Synechococcus               and photosynthetic pico-eukaryotes NO               3               -               uptake rates were higher than               Prochlorococcus               ones.

  abstract = {Significance                            The coastal Southern Ocean is a critical climate system component and home to high rates of photosynthesis. Here we show that cobalamin (vitamin B               12               ) and iron availability can simultaneously limit phytoplankton growth in late Austral summer coastal Antarctic sea ice edge communities. Unlike other growth-limiting nutrients, the sole cobalamin source is production by bacteria and archaea. By identifying microbial gene expression changes in response to altered micronutrient availability, we describe the molecular underpinnings of limitation by both cobalamin and iron and offer evidence that this limitation is driven by multiple delicately balanced phytoplankton--bacterial interactions. These results support a growing body of research suggesting that relationships between bacteria and phytoplankton are key to understanding controls on marine primary productivity.                        ,                             Southern Ocean primary productivity plays a key role in global ocean biogeochemistry and climate. At the Southern Ocean sea ice edge in coastal McMurdo Sound, we observed simultaneous cobalamin and iron limitation of surface water phytoplankton communities in late Austral summer. Cobalamin is produced only by bacteria and archaea, suggesting phytoplankton--bacterial interactions must play a role in this limitation. To characterize these interactions and investigate the molecular basis of multiple nutrient limitation, we examined transitions in global gene expression over short time scales, induced by shifts in micronutrient availability. Diatoms, the dominant primary producers, exhibited transcriptional patterns indicative of co-occurring iron and cobalamin deprivation. The major contributor to cobalamin biosynthesis gene expression was a gammaproteobacterial population,               Oceanospirillaceae               ASP10-02a. This group also contributed significantly to metagenomic cobalamin biosynthesis gene abundance throughout Southern Ocean surface waters.               Oceanospirillaceae               ASP10-02a displayed elevated expression of organic matter acquisition and cell surface attachment-related genes, consistent with a mutualistic relationship in which they are dependent on phytoplankton growth to fuel cobalamin production. Separate bacterial groups, including               Methylophaga               , appeared to rely on phytoplankton for carbon and energy sources, but displayed gene expression patterns consistent with iron and cobalamin deprivation. This suggests they also compete with phytoplankton and are important cobalamin consumers. Expression patterns of siderophore- related genes offer evidence for bacterial influences on iron availability as well. The nature and degree of this episodic colimitation appear to be mediated by a series of phytoplankton--bacterial interactions in both positive and negative feedback loops.},

Although field studies have provided evidence for nitrate uptake by Prochlorococcus, little is known about this trait because axenic cultures capable of growth on nitrate have not been available. Additionally, all previously sequenced genomes lacked the genes necessary for nitrate assimilation. Here we introduce three Prochlorococcus strains capable of growth on nitrate and analyze their physiology and genome architecture. We show that the growth of high-light (HL) adapted strains on nitrate is {$\sim$}17\% slower than their growth on ammonium. By analyzing 41 Prochlorococcus genomes, we find that genes for nitrate assimilation have been gained multiple times during the evolution of this group, and can be found in at least three lineages. In low-light adapted strains, nitrate assimilation genes are located in the same genomic context as in marine Synechococcus. These genes are located elsewhere in HL adapted strains and may often exist as a stable genetic acquisition as suggested by the striking degree of similarity in the order, phylogeny and location of these genes in one HL adapted strain and a consensus assembly of environmental Prochlorococcus metagenome sequences. In another HL adapted strain, nitrate utilization genes may have been independently acquired as indicated by adjacent phage mobility elements; these genes are also duplicated with each copy detected in separate genomic islands. These results provide direct evidence for nitrate utilization by Prochlorococcus and illuminate the complex evolutionary history of this trait.},

Here, we have surveyed the literature involving planktonic protist interactions and gathered the information in a manually curated               Protist Interaction DAtabase               (PIDA). In total, we have registered {\textasciitilde}2500 ecological interactions from {\textasciitilde}500 publications, spanning the last 150 years. All major protistan lineages were involved in interactions as hosts, symbionts (mutualists and commensalists), parasites, predators, and/or prey. Predation was the most common interaction (39\% of all records), followed by symbiosis (29\%), parasitism (18\%), and `unresolved interactions' (14\%, where it is uncertain whether the interaction is beneficial or antagonistic). Using bipartite networks, we found that protist predators seem to be `multivorous' while parasite--host and symbiont--host interactions appear to have moderate degrees of specialization. The SAR supergroup (i.e., Stramenopiles, Alveolata, and Rhizaria) heavily dominated PIDA, and comparisons against a global-ocean molecular survey (               TARA Oceans               ) indicated that several SAR lineages, which are abundant and diverse in the marine realm, were underrepresented among the recorded interactions.

To test possible sources of this variability, we used the diatom               Thalassiosira weissflogii               as a model and manipulated its growth rate through nutrient limitation and through exposure to three different temperatures (15{$^\circ$}C, 20{$^\circ$}C, and 25{$^\circ$}C). We simplified the ATP protocol with hot-water or chemical extraction methods, modified a commercially available luciferin-luciferase assay, and employed single-photon counting in a scintillation counter, all of which increased sensitivity and throughput. Per-cell ATP levels remained relatively constant despite changes in growth rates by approximately 10-fold in the batch culture (i.e., nutrient limitation) experiments, and approximately 2-fold in response to temperature. The re-examination of related literature values revealed that average cellular ATP levels differed little among taxonomic groups of aquatic microbes, even at the domain level, and correlated well with bulk properties such as elemental carbon or nitrogen. Fulfilling multiple cellular functions in addition to being the universal energy currency requires ATP to be maintained in a millimolar concentration range. Consequently, ATP relates directly to live cytoplasm volume, while elemental carbon and nitrogen are constrained by an indeterminate pool of detrital material and intracellular storage compounds. The ATP-biomass indicator is sensitive, economical, and can be readily standardized among laboratories and across environments.},

  abstract = {The biological carbon pump exports carbon fixed by photosynthesis out of the surface ocean and transfers it to the deep, mostly in the form of sinking particles. Despite the importance of the pump in regulating the air-sea CO               2               balance, the magnitude of global carbon export remains unclear, as do its controlling mechanisms. A possible sinking flux of carbon to the mesopelagic zone may be via the mixed-layer pump: a seasonal net detrainment of particulate organic carbon (POC)-rich surface waters, caused by sequential deepening and shoaling of the mixed layer. In this study, we present a full year of daily small-particle POC concentrations derived from glider optical backscatter data, to study export variability at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) sustained observatory in the Northeast Atlantic. We observe a strong seasonality in small-particle transfer efficiency, with a maximum in winter and early spring. By calculating daily POC export driven by mixed-layer variations, we find that the mixed-layer pump supplies an annual flux of at least 3.0 {\textpm} 0.9 g POC{$\cdot$}m               -2               {$\cdot$}year               -1               to the mesopelagic zone, contributing between 5\% and 25\% of the total annual export flux and likely contributing to closing a gap in the mesopelagic carbon budget found by other studies.

  abstract = {A large-volume mesocosm-based nutrient perturbation experiment was conducted off the island of Hawai`i, USA, to investigate the response of surface ocean phytoplankton communities to the addition of macronutrients, trace metals, and vitamins and to assess the feasibility of using mesocosms in the open ocean. Three free-drifting mesocosms ({\textasciitilde}60 m               3               ) were deployed: one mesocosm served as a control (no nutrient amendments); a second (termed +P) was amended with nitrate (N), silicate (Si), phosphate (P), and a trace metal + vitamin mixture; and a third (termed -P) was amended with N, Si, and a trace metal + vitamin mixture but no P. These mesocosms were unreplicated due to logistical constraints and hence differences between treatments are qualitative. After 6 d, the largest response of the phytoplankton community was observed in the +P mesocosm, where chlorophyll a and               14               C-based primary production were 2-3{\texttimes} greater than in the -P mesocosm and 4-6{\texttimes} greater than in the control. Comparison between mesocosm and `microcosm' incubations (20 l) revealed differences in the magnitude and timing of production and marked differences in community structure with a reduced response of diatoms in microcosm treatments. Notably, we also observed pronounced declines in Prochlorococcus populations in all treatments, although these were greater in microcosms (up to 99\%). Overall, this study confirmed the feasibility of deploying free-drifting mesocosms in the open ocean as a potentially powerful tool to investigate ecological impacts of nutrient perturbations and constitutes a valuable first step towards scaling plankton manipulation experiments.},

  abstract = {Fueled by light, phytoplankton produce the organic matter that supports ocean ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Ocean change impacts microbial metabolism with repercussions for biogeochemical cycling.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Light fuels photosynthesis and organic matter production by primary producers in the sunlit ocean. The quantity and quality of the organic matter produced influence community function, yet               in situ               measurements of metabolites, the products of cellular metabolism, over the diel cycle are lacking. We evaluated community-level biochemical consequences of oscillations of light in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre by quantifying 79 metabolites in particulate organic matter from 15 m every 4 h over 8 days. Total particulate metabolite concentration peaked at dusk and represented up to 2\% of total particulate organic carbon (POC). The concentrations of 55/79 (70\%) individual metabolites exhibited significant 24-h periodicity, with daily fold changes from 1.6 to 12.8, often greater than those of POC and flow cytometry-resolvable biomass, which ranged from 1.2 to 2.8. Paired metatranscriptome analysis revealed the taxa involved in production and consumption of a subset of metabolites. Primary metabolites involved in anabolism and redox maintenance had significant 24-h periodicity and diverse organisms exhibited diel periodicity in transcript abundance associated with these metabolites. Compounds with osmotic properties displayed the largest oscillations in concentration, implying rapid turnover and supporting prior evidence of functions beyond cell turgor maintenance. The large daily oscillation of trehalose paired with metatranscriptome and culture data showed that trehalose is produced by the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium               Crocosphaera               , likely to store energy for nighttime metabolism. Together, paired measurements of particulate metabolites and transcripts resolve strategies that microbes use to manage daily energy and redox oscillations and highlight dynamic metabolites with cryptic roles in marine microbial ecosystems.                                         IMPORTANCE               Fueled by light, phytoplankton produce the organic matter that supports ocean ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Ocean change impacts microbial metabolism with repercussions for biogeochemical cycling. As the small molecule products of cellular metabolism, metabolites often change rapidly in response to environmental conditions and form the basis of energy and nutrient management and storage within cells. By pairing measurements of metabolites and gene expression in the stratified surface ocean, we reveal strategies of microbial energy management over the day-night cycle and hypothesize that oscillating metabolites are important substrates for dark respiration by phytoplankton. These high-resolution diel measurements of               in situ               metabolite concentrations form the basis for future work into the specific roles these compounds play in marine microbial communities.},

As a component of labile organic matter, GBT has complex biochemical potential as a substrate for microbial use that is unconstrained in the environment. Here we determine the uptake kinetics and metabolic fate of GBT in two natural microbial communities in the North Pacific characterized by different nitrate concentrations. Dissolved GBT had maximum uptake rates of 0.36 and 0.56\,nM\,h               -1               with half-saturation constants of 79 and 11\,nM in the high nitrate and low nitrate stations respectively. During multiday incubations, most GBT taken into cells was retained as a compatible solute. Stable isotopes derived from the added GBT were also observed in other metabolites, including choline, carnitine and sarcosine, suggesting that GBT was used for biosynthesis and for catabolism to pyruvate and ammonium. Where nitrate was scarce, GBT was primarily metabolized via demethylation to glycine. Gene transcript data were consistent with SAR11 using GBT as a source of methyl groups to fuel the methionine cycle. Where nitrate concentrations were higher, more GBT was partitioned for lipid biosynthesis by both bacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Our data highlight unexpected metabolic pathways and potential routes of microbial metabolite exchange.},

Characterizing the diversity of cross-feeding pathways in ocean microbes illuminates evolutionary forces driving self-organization of ocean ecosystems.

The cyanobacterium               Prochlorococcus               exudes both compound classes, which metabolic reconstructions suggest follows synchronous daily genome replication. Co-occurring heterotrophs differentiate into purine- and pyrimidine-using generalists or specialists that use compounds for different purposes. The most abundant heterotroph, SAR11, is a specialist that uses purines as sources of energy, carbon, and/or nitrogen, with subgroups differentiating along ocean-scale gradients in the supply of energy and nitrogen, in turn producing putative cryptic nitrogen cycles that link many microbes. Last, in an SAR11 subgroup that dominates where               Prochlorococcus               is abundant, adenine additions to cultures inhibit DNA synthesis, poising cells for replication. We argue that this subgroup uses inferred daily adenine pulses from               Prochlorococcus               to synchronize to the daily photosynthate supply from surrounding phytoplankton.                        ,              Global marine microbial marketplace for DNA building blocks drives biogeochemical cycling and ecological signaling in the ocean.},

The persistence of these high concentrations led to the view that the DON pool was largely refractory and therefore unimportant to plankton nutrition. Any DON that was utilized was believed to fuel bacterial production. More recent work, however, indicates that fluxes into and out of the DON pool can be large, and that the constancy in concentration is a function of tightly coupled production and consumption processes. Evidence is also accumulating which indicates that phytoplankton, including a number of harmful species, may obtain a substantial part of their nitrogen nutrition from organic compounds. Ongoing research includes ways to discriminate between autotrophic and heterotrophic utilization, as well as a number of mechanisms, such as cell surface enzymes and photochemical decomposition, that could facilitate phytoplankton use of DON components.},

Manganese can be co-limiting with iron in parts of the Southern Ocean, whilst phosphate and cobalt can be co-/serially limiting in some settings. Overall, an analysis of experimental responses showed that phytoplankton net growth can be significantly enhanced through increasing the number of different nutrients supplied, regardless of latitude, temperature, or trophic status, implying surface seawaters are often approaching nutrient co-limitation. Assessments of nutrient deficiency based on seawater nutrient concentrations and nutrient stress diagnosed via molecular biomarkers showed good agreement with experimentally-assessed nutrient limitation, validating conceptual and theoretical links between nutrient stoichiometry and microbial ecophysiology.},

Because nitrogen is a major nutrient that is required by all life, its availability can control biological productivity and ecosystem structure in both surface and deep-ocean communities. Stable isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate and nitrite have provided new insights into the rates and distributions of marine nitrogen cycle processes, especially when analyzed in combination with numerical simulations of ocean circulation and biogeochemistry. This review highlights the insights gained from dual-isotope studies applied at regional to global scales and their incorporation into oceanic biogeochemical models. These studies represent significant new advances in the use of isotopic measurements to understand the modern nitrogen cycle, with implications for the study of past ocean productivity, oxygenation, and nutrient status.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Because of its temperate location, high dynamic range of environmental conditions, and extensive human activity, the long-term ecological research site in the coastal Northeastern US Shelf (NES) of the northwestern Atlantic Ocean offers an ideal opportunity to understand how productivity shifts in response to changes in planktonic community composition. Ocean production and trophic transfer rates, including net community production (NCP), net primary production (NPP), gross oxygen production (GOP), and microzooplankton grazing rates, are key metrics for understanding marine ecosystem dynamics and associated impacts on biogeochemical cycles. Although small phytoplankton usually dominate phytoplankton community composition and Chl~a concentration in the NES waters during the summer, in August 2019, a bloom of the large diatom genus Hemiaulus, with N2-fixing symbionts, was observed in the mid-shelf region. NCP was 2.5 to 9 times higher when Hemiaulus dominated phytoplankton carbon compared to NCP throughout the same geographic area during the summers of 2020--2022. The Hemiaulus bloom in summer 2019 also coincided with higher trophic transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to microzooplankton and higher GOP and NPP than in the summers 2020--2022. This study suggests that the dominance of an atypical phytoplankton community that alters the typical size distribution of primary producers can significantly influence productivity and trophic transfer, highlighting the dynamic nature of the coastal ocean. Notably, summer 2018 NCP levels were also high, although the size distribution of Chl~a was typical and an atypical phytoplankton community was not observed. A better understanding of the dynamics of the NES in terms of biological productivity is of primary importance, especially in the context of changing environmental conditions due to climate processes.},

This primary production supports essentially all life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how marine primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability. Global marine primary production appears to have increased over the past several decades in association with multi-decadal variations. A paleoclimate record extends discussion to the centennial scale, providing contrasting insights into how marine primary production might vary in the future.},

This ``metabolic cost hypothesis'' implies that there should be a growth disadvantage on nitrate compared to ammonium or other forms of reduced nitrogen such as urea, especially when light limits growth, but in a variety of phytoplankton taxa, this predicted difference has not been observed. Our experiments with three strains of marine               Synechococcus               (WH7803, WH7805, and WH8112) did not reveal consistently faster growth (cell division) on ammonium or urea as compared to nitrate. Urease and glutamine synthetase (GS) activities varied with nitrogen source in a manner consistent with regulation by cellular nitrogen status via NtcA (rather than by external availability of nitrogen) in all three strains and indicated that each strain experienced some degree of nitrogen insufficiency during growth on nitrate. At light intensities that strongly limited growth, the composition (carbon, nitrogen, and pigment quotas) of WH7805 cells using nitrate was indistinguishable from that of cells using ammonium, but at saturating light intensities, cellular carbon, nitrogen, and pigment quotas were significantly lower in cells using nitrate than ammonium. These and similar results from other phytoplankton taxa suggest that a limitation in some step of nitrate uptake or assimilation, rather than the extra cost of reducing nitrate per se, may be the cause of differences in growth and physiology between cells using nitrate and ammonium.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) are ubiquitous features in stratified oceanic systems. Their establishment and maintenance result from hydrographical stability favoring specific environmental conditions with respect to light and nutrient availability required for phytoplankton growth. This stability can potentially be challenged by mesoscale eddies impacting the water column's vertical structure and thus the environmental parameters that condition the subsistence of DCMs. Here, data from the global BGC-Argo float network are collocated with mesoscale eddies to explore their impact on DCMs. We show that cyclonic eddies, by providing optimal light and nutrient conditions, increase the occurrence of DCMs characterized by Deep Biomass Maxima for phytoplankton. In contrast, DCMs in anticyclonic eddies seem to be driven by photoacclimation as they coincide with Deep Acclimation Maxima without biomass accumulation. These findings suggest that the two types of eddies potentially have different impacts on the role of DCMs in global primary production.           ,              Plain Language Summary             In the global ocean, phytoplankton can be found at depths where their growth is limited by their access to light from the surface and nutrient supply from below. Depending on the combination of environmental conditions, phytoplankton at depth can either accumulate in densely populated layers or deploy adaptive survival strategies such as multiplying their internal light sensors. Given their dependence on environmental variations, phytoplankton can be affected by physical disturbances that alter the vertical structure of the water column's properties. Among these are mesoscale eddies, large water structures dominated by rotation on the horizontal plane which also induce vertical physical movements. In this study, we associate data from autonomous robots that drift with ocean currents and sample physical and biological properties down to a depth of 2,000~meters, with mesoscale eddies detected by satellite. We show that on a global scale, cold mesoscale eddies promote the growth of phytoplankton at depth.           ,              Key Points                                                                Deep Chlorophyll Maxima are key biological features of stratified environments that escape satellite ocean-color detection                                                     The impact of mesoscale eddies on DCM is assessed by matching a global BGC-Argo database with eddies detected from satellite altimetry                                                     While cyclonic eddies increase biomass maxima occurrences, anticyclonic eddies favor the presence of maxima resulting from photoacclimation},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Intense bottom-ice algal blooms, often dominated by diatoms, are an important source of food for grazers, organic matter for export during sea ice melt, and dissolved organic carbon. Sea-ice diatoms have a number of adaptations, including accumulation of compatible solutes, that allows them to inhabit this highly variable environment characterized by extremes in temperature, salinity, and light. In addition to protecting them from extreme conditions, these compounds present a labile, nutrient-rich source of organic matter, and include precursors to climate active compounds (e.g., dimethyl sulfide [DMS]), which are likely regulated with environmental change. Here, intracellular concentrations of 45 metabolites were quantified in three sea-ice diatom species and were compared to two temperate diatom species, with a focus on compatible solutes and free amino acid pools. There was a large diversity of metabolite concentrations between diatoms with no clear pattern identifiable for sea-ice species. Concentrations of some compatible solutes (isethionic acid, homarine) approached 1\,M in the sea-ice diatoms, Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Navicula cf. perminuta, but not in the larger sea-ice diatom, Nitzschia lecointei or in the temperate diatom species. The differential use of compatible solutes in sea-ice diatoms suggests different adaptive strategies and highlights which small organic compounds may be important in polar biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Seasonal cycles within the marginal ice zones in polar regions include large shifts in temperature and salinity that strongly influence microbial abundance and physiology. However, the combined effects of concurrent temperature and salinity change on microbial community structure and biochemical composition during transitions between seawater and sea ice are not well understood. Coastal marine communities along the western Antarctic Peninsula were sampled and surface seawater was incubated at combinations of temperature and salinity mimicking the formation (cold, salty) and melting (warm, fresh) of sea ice to evaluate how these factors may shape community composition and particulate metabolite pools during seasonal transitions. Bacterial and algal community structures were tightly coupled to each other and distinct across sea-ice, seawater, and sea-ice-meltwater field samples, with unique metabolite profiles in each habitat. During short-term (approximately 10-day) incubations of seawater microbial communities under different temperature and salinity conditions, community compositions changed minimally while metabolite pools shifted greatly, strongly accumulating compatible solutes like proline and glycine betaine under cold and salty conditions. Lower salinities reduced total metabolite concentrations in particulate matter, which may indicate a release of metabolites into the labile dissolved organic matter pool. Low salinity also increased acylcarnitine concentrations in particulate matter, suggesting a potential for fatty acid degradation and reduced nutritional value at the base of the food web during freshening. Our findings have consequences for food web dynamics, microbial interactions, and carbon cycling as polar regions undergo rapid climate change.},

  abstract = {Microbial life in the ocean contains immense taxonomic and physiological diversity, yet its collective activity yields global cycles of the major biolimiting elements N and P that are tightly linked. Moreover, the availability of N and P in seawater is closely matched to the metabolic demands of ``average'' plankton, as if plankton composition and the oceanic nutrient reservoirs were mutually influenced. These simple observations have broad implications for the function of nutrient cycles within the Earth system, which can operate either as a biological homeostat that buffers ocean fertility against large changes or as an amplifier of climate perturbations, by alleviating or exacerbating the nutrient limitation of biological productivity and ocean C storage. A mechanistic understanding of these observations and dynamics must draw upon diverse fields, from physiology and evolution to physical oceanography and paleoceanography, and must account for processes spanning a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Here we summarize this understanding from the perspective of the nutrient distributions themselves and their changes over time. We offer a synthesis view in which ocean circulation communicates the resource constraints of stoichiometrically distinct planktonic biomes across large spatial scales, allowing geochemical constancy to emerge from rich biological diversity.},

Early reports demonstrated the streamlining of regulatory mechanisms in nitrogen metabolism and the removal of genes not strictly essential. The availability of a large series of genomes, and the utilization of latest generation molecular techniques have allowed elucidating the main mechanisms developed by marine picocyanobacteria to adapt to the environments where they thrive, with a particular interest in the strains inhabiting oligotrophic oceans. Given that nitrogen is often limited in those environments, a series of studies have explored the strategies utilized by Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus to exploit the low concentrations of nitrogen-containing molecules available in large areas of the oceans. These strategies include the reduction in the GC and the cellular protein contents; the utilization of truncated proteins; a reduced average amount of N in the proteome; the development of metabolic mechanisms to perceive and utilize nanomolar nitrate concentrations; and the reduced responsiveness of key molecular regulatory systems such as NtcA to 2-oxoglutarate. These findings are in sharp contrast with the large body of knowledge obtained in freshwater cyanobacteria. We will outline the main discoveries, stressing their relevance to the ecological success of these important microorganisms.},

  abstract = {The fate of photosynthetic carbon in marine ecosystems dominated by different types of primary producers was examined by compiling published reports on herbivory, autotrophic respiration, decomposition, carbon storage, and export rates as fractions of net primary production (NPP) in ecosystems dominated by different types of autotrophs (i.e. oceanic and coastal phytoplankton, microphytobenthos, coral reef algae, macroalgae, seagrasses, marsh plants, and mangroves). A large fraction ({$>$}40\%) of the NPP of marine ecosystems is decomposed within the system, except for microphytobenthos (decomposition, {$\sim$}25\% of NPP). Herbivory tends to be highest for microalgae (planktonic and benthic, {$>$}40\% of NPP) and macroalgae (33.6 {\textpm}4.9\% of NPP) and is somewhat less for higher plants. Microphytobenthos export on average a much higher proportion of their NPP than do other microalgal communities, whereas marine macrophytes, except marsh plants, export a substantial proportion (24.3--43.5\% on average) of their NPP. fraction of NPP stored in sediments is 4-fold greater for higher plants ({$\sim$}10--17\% of NPP) than for algae (0.4--6\% of NPP). On average, {$\sim$}90\% of the phytoplankton NPP is used to support local heterotrophic metabolism (i.e. grazed or decomposed). This fraction is even higher in oceanic communities. Mangrove forests, and to a lesser extent seagrass meadows and macroalgal beds, produce organic carbon well in excess of the ecosystem requirements, with excess photosynthetic carbon (i.e. export rate plus storage) in these ecosystem representing {$\sim$}40\% of NPP. Extrapolation of these results to the global ocean identifies marine angiosperms, which only contribute 4\% of total ocean NPP, as major contributors of the NPP stored (30\% of total ocean carbon storage) and subsequently buried in marine sediments. Consideration of burial of NPP from marine angiosperms should lead to estimates of total burial of marine NPP that exceed current estimates by 15--50\%.},

Heterotrophic metabolism can prevail where heterotrophic activity is subsidized by organic carbon inputs from the continental shelf or the atmosphere and from nonphotosynthetic autotrophic and mixotrophic metabolic pathways. The growth of the oligotrophic regions is likely to be tilting the metabolic balance of the ocean toward a greater prevalence of heterotrophic communities.},

  abstract = {For more than a decade there has been controversy in oceanography regarding the metabolic state of the oligotrophic subtropical gyres of the open ocean. Here we review the background of this controversy, commenting on several issues to set the context for a moderated debate between two groups of scientists. In one of the two companion articles, Williams et al. (2013) take the view that these gyres exhibit a state of net autotrophy---that is, their gross primary production (GPP) exceeds community respiration (R) when averaged over some suitably extensive region and over a long duration. In the other companion article, Duarte et al. (2013) take the opposite view, that these gyres are net heterotrophic, with R exceeding the GPP. This idea---that large, remote areas of the upper ocean could be net heterotrophic---raises a host of fundamental scientific questions about the metabolic processes of photosynthesis and respiration that underlie ocean ecology and global biogeochemistry. The question remains unresolved in part because the net state is finely balanced between large opposing fluxes and most current measurements have large uncertainties. This challenging question must be studied against the background of large, anthropogenically driven changes in ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. Current trends of anthropogenic change make it an urgent problem to solve and also greatly complicate finding that solution.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, the daily pulse of photosynthetic carbon (C) fixation is closely balanced by losses. This concert of growth and loss is driven by a diverse assemblage of plankton, including the diazotroph               Crocosphaera               sp. While primary production is relatively well characterized in this ecosystem, the extent of C transfer to secondary producers is poorly constrained. Here, we use automated imaging flow cytometry and population modeling to study the coupling of C production by               Crocosphaera               and subsequent grazing by nanoplanktonic protists.               Crocosphaera               cells represent on average 30\% of the nanoplankton detected by the Imaging FlowCytoBot in the surface layer of mesoscale eddies during summertime. The size spectra show a maximum in the frequency of               Crocosphaera               doublet cells just prior to mitotic division at midday, with an average estimated growth rate of 0.8\,{\textpm}\,0.5 d               -1               . We also identified potential predators by fitting a Lotka--Volterra model to plankton time series observations. Significant predators include the dinoflagellates               Protoperidinium               and               Dinophysis               as well as the ciliate               Strombidium               , which were all imaged with               Crocosphaera               in food vacuoles. The estimated C demand of the main grazers fluctuated between 25\% and 250\% of               Crocosphaera               new production in an anticyclonic eddy where we observed the onset of a               Crocosphaera               -driven bloom. Heterotrophic               Protoperidinium               drove most of the estimated C demand, with grazing rates nearly equivalent to               Crocosphaera               growth rates (0.6\,{\textpm}\,0.4 d               -1               on average), but saturating at high prey concentrations.

We sampled two pairs of mesoscale cyclones and anticyclones in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in 2017 and 2018 and compared our observations with seasonal patterns from the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program. Consistent with previous reports, we found that NFRs were anomalously high for this region (up to 3.7-fold above previous monthly HOT observations) in the centers of both sampled anticyclones. In 2017, these elevated rates coincided with high concentrations of the diazotroph               Crocosphaera               . We then coupled our field-based observations, together with transcriptomic analyses of nutrient stress marker genes and ecological models, to evaluate the role of biological (via estimates of growth and grazing rates) and physical controls on populations of               Crocosphaera               ,               Trichodesmium               , and diatom symbionts at the mesoscale. Our results suggest that increased               Crocosphaera               abundances in the 2017 anticyclone resulted from the alleviation of phosphate limitation, allowing cells to grow at rates exceeding grazing losses. In contrast, distributions of larger, buoyant taxa (               Trichodesmium               and diatom symbionts) appeared less affected by eddy-driven biological controls.

No examined controls were able to explain our 2018 findings of higher NFRs in the anticyclone.

Early studies conceptualized this link as the passive addition and removal of organic compounds from a shared seawater reservoir. Here, we analysed transcript and intracellular metabolite patterns in a two-member model system and found that the presence of a heterotrophic bacterium induced a potential recognition cascade in a marine phytoplankton species that parallels better-understood vascular plant response systems. Bacterium               Ruegeria pomeroyi               DSS-3 triggered differential expression of {$>$}80 genes in diatom               Thalassiosira pseudonana               CCMP1335 that are homologs to those used by plants to recognize external stimuli, including proteins putatively involved in leucine-rich repeat recognition activity, second messenger production and protein kinase cascades. Co-cultured diatoms also downregulated lipid biosynthesis genes and upregulated chitin metabolism genes. From differential expression of bacterial transporter systems, we hypothesize that nine diatom metabolites supported the majority of bacterial growth, among them sulfonates, sugar derivatives and organic nitrogen compounds. Similar recognition responses and metabolic linkages as observed in this model system may influence carbon transformations by ocean plankton.},

Yet, specific factors that determine community composition and metabolic activity are difficult to resolve in complex microbial populations, complicating predictions of microbial processes in a changing ocean. Microbial metabolism generates small organic molecules that reflect both the biochemical and physiological diversity as well as the taxonomic specificity of these biological processes. These small molecules serve as the conduit for taxon-specific signaling and exchange. Here, we use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics to taxonomically categorize 111 metabolites that include small molecules in central and secondary metabolism across 42 taxa representing numerically dominant and metabolically important lineages of microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs. Patterns in metabolite presence-absence broadly reflected taxonomic lineages. A subset of metabolites that includes osmolytes, sulfur-containing metabolites, sugars, and amino acid derivatives provided chemotaxonomic information among phytoplankton taxa. A variety of phytohormones and signaling molecules were predominantly found in the heterotrophic bacteria and archaea, expanding knowledge of metabolites implicated in modulating interactions between microbes. This chemotaxonomic inventory of marine microbial metabolites is a key step in deciphering metabolic networks that influence ocean biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To better quantify the ocean's biological carbon pump, we resolved the diversity of sinking particles that transport carbon into the ocean's interior, their contribution to carbon export, and their attenuation with depth. Sinking particles collected in sediment trap gel layers from four distinct ocean ecosystems were imaged, measured, and classified. The size and identity of particles was used to model their contribution to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux. Measured POC fluxes were reasonably predicted by particle images. Nine particle types were identified, and most of the compositional variability was driven by the relative contribution of aggregates, long cylindrical fecal pellets, and salp fecal pellets. While particle composition varied across locations and seasons, the entire range of compositions was measured at a single well-observed location in the subarctic North Pacific over one month, across 500~m of depth. The magnitude of POC flux was not consistently associated with a dominant particle class, but particle classes did influence flux attenuation. Long fecal pellets attenuated most rapidly with depth whereas certain other classes attenuated little or not at all with depth. Small particles ({$<$}100~{$\mu$}m) consistently contributed {$\sim$}5\% to total POC flux in samples with higher magnitude fluxes. The relative importance of these small particle classes (spherical mini pellets, short oval fecal pellets, and dense detritus) increased in low flux environments (up to 46\% of total POC flux). Imaging approaches that resolve large variations in particle composition across ocean basins, depth, and time will help to better parameterize biological carbon pump models.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Sinking particles transport carbon from the surface ocean to depth where carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere for long time periods. The amount of carbon transported by this process is difficult to quantify, in part because of the complex ecological interactions that generate sinking particles and alter downward transport. This study combined chemical measurements with detailed imagery of sinking particles collected in drifting sediment traps to survey how different types of particles affect carbon export across five locations. The biological characteristics of imaged particles can be used to reasonably predict carbon export and its attenuation with depth. Measured particles were classified into nine different categories, including various types of aggregates, organisms, and zooplankton fecal pellets. The amount of sinking carbon was not related to the dominance of any specific particle type, but each type transported carbon with differing efficiencies. Episodic presence of fecal pellets produced by gelatinous zooplankton had a large influence on transport of carbon to depth. Particles often considered too small to contribute to carbon export ({$<$}100~{\textmu}m) were consistently important, especially in low flux environments, and often attenuated relatively little with depth. Resolving biological details of sinking particles improves our ability to quantify the ocean's carbon cycle.           ,              Key Points                                                                Carbon flux into the deep ocean by sinking particles can be reasonably predicted from images of collected particle flux                                                     Sinking particle type and trophic processing affect attenuation of carbon flux with depth                                                     Particles smaller than 100~{$\mu$}m can be an important component of sinking carbon and some attenuated little with depth},

As such, they are used as biomarkers in the modern ocean and as paleoproxies to explore the geological past. Here, I review lipid geochemistry, biosynthesis, and compartmentalization; the varied uses of lipids as biomarkers; and the evolution of analytical techniques used to measure and characterize lipids. Advancements in high-resolution accurate-mass mass spectrometry have revolutionized the lipidomic and metabolomic fields, both of which are quickly being integrated into marine meta-omic studies. Lipidomics allows us to analyze tens of thousands of features, providing an open analytical window and the ability to quantify unknown compounds that can be structurally elucidated later. However, lipidome annotation is not a trivial matter and represents one of the biggest challenges for oceanographers, owing in part to the lack of marine lipids in current in silico databases and data repositories. A case study reveals the gaps in our knowledge and open opportunities to answer fundamental questions about molecular-level control of chemical reactions and global-scale patterns in the lipidscape.},

Yet, it is unclear to what extent phytoplankton exudates also provide nutrients such as phytoplankton-derived N and P (DONp, DOPp). We address these questions by mesocosm exudate addition experiments with spent media from the ubiquitous pico-cyanobacterium               Prochlorococcus               to bacterial communities in contrasting ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean -- a coastal and an open-ocean, oligotrophic station with and without on-top additions of inorganic nutrients. Inorganic nutrient addition did not lower the incorporation of exudate DONp, nor did it reduce alkaline phosphatase activity, suggesting that bacterial communities are able to exclusively cover their nitrogen and phosphorus demands with organic forms provided by phytoplankton exudates. Approximately half of the cells in each ecosystem took up detectable amounts of               Prochlorococcus               -derived C and N, yet based on 16S rRNA sequencing different bacterial genera were responsible for the observed exudate utilization patterns.

Together, our results strongly indicate that phytoplankton exudates provide coastal and open-ocean bacterial communities with organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and that phytoplankton exudate serve a full-fledged meal for the accompanying bacterial community in the nutrient-poor eastern Mediterranean.},

The observations indicate strong variability in particle export and bio-optical properties, influenced by the spring bloom, mesoscale eddy activity, and the mixed layer pump. Temporal and vertical decoupling of fluxes at depths ranging from 150 to 1,000~m was also observed, and remineralization length scales were more variable than predicted by temperature- and oxygen-based models. Net primary production was computed from float observations using a modification of the Carbon-based Productivity Model and used to estimate export and export (e-) ratios, which were compared to predictions of literature export models.

A key concept for such synthesis in ecology is the niche, the set of capabilities that enables a population's persistence and defines its impact on the environment. The set of possible niches forms the niche space, a conceptual space delineating ways in which persistence in a system is possible. Here we use manifold learning to map the space of metabolic networks representing thousands of bacterial genera. The results suggest a metabolic niche space comprising a collection of discrete clusters and branching manifolds, which constitute strategies spanning life in different habitats and hosts. We further demonstrate that communities from similar ecosystem types map to characteristic regions of this functional coordinate system, permitting coarse-graining of microbiomes in terms of ecological niches that may be filled.},

Ectoine is known as a bacterial compatible solute, but, to the best of our knowledge, was never considered as a phytoplankton-derived product. Given the ability of microalgae to take up zwitterions, such as DMSP, we tested the hypothesis that the algal ectoine is derived from associated bacteria. We therefore analyzed methanol extracts of xenic and axenic cultures of two different species of microalgae and could detect elevated concentrations of ectoine in those that harbor associated bacteria. However, also microalgae without an associated microbiome contain ectoine in smaller amounts, pointing towards a dual origin of this metabolite in the algae from their own biosynthesis as well as from uptake. We also tested the role of ectoine in the osmoadaptation of microalgae. In the model diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, elevated amounts of ectoine were found when cultivated in seawater with salinities of 50 PSU compared to the standard culture conditions of 35 PSU. Therefore, we add ectoine to the family of osmoadaptive metabolites in phytoplankton and prove a new, potentially synergistic metabolic interplay of bacteria and algae.},

Yet whether this consistent ecological pattern reflects the result of resource-based niche partitioning or resource competition requires better knowledge of the metabolites linking microbial autotrophs and heterotrophs in the surface ocean. We characterized molecules targeted for uptake by three heterotrophic bacteria individually co-cultured with a marine diatom using two strategies that vetted the exometabolite pool for biological relevance by means of bacterial activity assays: expression of diagnostic genes and net drawdown of exometabolites, the latter detected with mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance using novel sample preparation approaches. Of the more than 36 organic molecules with evidence of bacterial uptake, 53\% contained nitrogen (including nucleosides and amino acids), 11\% were organic sulfur compounds (including dihydroxypropanesulfonate and dimethysulfoniopropionate), and 28\% were components of polysaccharides (including chrysolaminarin, chitin, and alginate). Overlap in phytoplankton-derived metabolite use by bacteria in the absence of competition was low, and only guanosine, proline, and               N               -acetyl-               d               -glucosamine were predicted to be used by all three.

We examined spatial variations in upper ocean (0--100\,m) nutrient inventories, N2 fixing microorganism diversity and abundance, and rates of N2 fixation in an anticyclonic eddy near Station ALOHA (22{$^\circ$} 45{$\prime$} N, 158{$^\circ$} 00{$\prime$} W) in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). In July 2005, satellite-based sea surface altimetry and ocean color observation revealed an anticyclonic eddy with enhanced chlorophyll in the upper ocean in the vicinity of Station ALOHA. Within the eddy, near-surface ocean chlorophyll concentrations were {$\sim$}5-fold greater than in the surrounding waters. Inventories of nitrate and phosphate in the eddy were similar to the concentrations historically observed at Station ALOHA, while silicic acid inventories were significantly depleted (one-way analysis of variance, P\&lt;0.01). Quantitative PCR determinations of nifH gene copies revealed relatively high abundances of several N2 fixing cyanobacteria, including Trichodesmium spp., Crocosphaera watsonii and Richelia intracellularis. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplified nitrogenase (nifH) gene transcripts were cloned and sequenced to examine the diversity of active N2 fixing microorganisms; these clone libraries were dominated by sequence-types 97\%--99\% identical to the filamentous cyanobacteria Trichodesmium spp. Near-surface ocean rates of N2 fixation were 2--18 times greater (averaging 8.6{\textpm}5.6\,nmol N per l per day) than previously reported measurements at Station ALOHA. These results suggest that mesoscale physical variability can play an important role in modifying the abundances of N2 fixing microorganisms and associated rates of N2 fixation in open ocean ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Introduction               Photosynthetic organisms respond to nitrogen (N) deprivation with the slowdown of photosynthesis and electron transport resulting in the balance the carbon (C)/N ratio. Under this extreme condition, organisms trigger complex mechanisms to keep growing using different N sources and recycling N containing molecules. In particular, phytoplankton are able to uptake L-arginine (L-Arg) as an organic N source. L-Arg can be assimilated mainly by the arginase, arginine deimidase, arginine decarboxylase or L-amino oxidase pathways.                                         Results                                We analyzed the effect of different N sources on the growth of the green algae                 Ostreococcus tauri                 . N starvation caused an inhibition of culture growth and a decrease in chlorophyll content. The addition of L-Arg to an N-deprived medium promotes a sustained growth rate of                 O. tauri                 culture and the increase of chlorophyll levels. The transcript level of genes involved in N uptake and metabolism were increased in N-starved condition while the addition of L-Arg as the sole N source reduced their induction. Since the                 O. tauri                 genome lacks the classical pathways to metabolize L-Arg, another enzyme/s may be responsible for L-Arg catabolism. Previously, we characterized the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme from                 O. tauri                 (OtNOS) which oxidizes L-Arg producing nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline. The NOS inhibitor L-NAME blocks the effect promoted by L-Arg on N-deprived                 O. tauri                 growth. Besides, NO level increased in                 O. tauri                 cells growing in L-Arg containing medium, suggesting the participation of OtNOS enzyme in L-Arg metabolism during N starvation.                                                        Discussion                                Our hypothesis suggests that, after NOS-dependent Arg degradation, non-enzymatic oxidation of NO produces N oxides (mainly NO                 2                 -                 ) that are re-incorporated to the N primary metabolism. As expected, N deprivation increases the lipid content in Ostreococcus. The addition of L-Arg or NO                 2                 -                 as the sole N sources showed a similar increase in lipid content to N deprivation. In summary, our results demonstrate that L-Arg is able to function as N source in Ostreococcus. The evidences on an alternative pathway of N supply and metabolism in a photosynthetic microorganism are discussed. These results could also allow the development of biotechnological tools for increasing lipid production for industry.},

Nucleosides and purine bases formed were taken up by distinct transport systems. We found a high-affinity common transport system for adenine, guanine, and hypoxanthine, with a Km of 40 nM. This system was inhibited noncompetitively by purine nucleosides. In addition, two transport systems for nucleosides were present: one for guanosine with a Km of 0.8 microM and another one for inosine and adenosine with a Km of 1.4 microM. The nucleoside transport systems exhibited both mixed and noncompetitive inhibition by different nucleosides other than those translocated; purine and pyrimidine bases had no effect. The transport of nucleosides and purine bases was inhibited by dinitrophenol or azide, thus suggesting that transport is energy dependent. Inside the cell all of the substrates were converted mainly into guanosine, xanthine, and uric acid, but also anabolic products, such as nucleotides and nucleic acids, could be found.},

In general, OAT serves to form glutamate from ornithine, with the notable exception of the intestine, where citrulline (Cit) or arginine (Arg) are end products. Its main function is to control the production of signaling molecules and mediators, such as Glu itself, Cit, GABA, and aliphatic polyamines. It is also involved in proline (Pro) synthesis.

It is currently unclear to what extent distinct DOM components can be used by different heterotrophic clades. Here, we ask how a natural microbial community from the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) responds to different molecular classes of DOM (peptides, amino acids, amino sugars, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and organic acids) comprising much of the biomass of living organisms. Bulk bacterial activity increased after 24 h for all treatments relative to the control, while glucose and ATP uptake decreased or remained unchanged. Moreover, while the per-cell uptake rate of glucose and ATP decreased, that of Leucin significantly increased for amino acids, reflecting their importance as common metabolic currencies in the marine environment.                 Pseudoalteromonadaceae                 dominated the peptides treatment, while different                 Vibrionaceae                 strains became dominant in response to amino acids and amino sugars.                 Marinomonadaceae                 grew well on organic acids, and                 Alteromonadaseae                 on disaccharides. A comparison with a recent laboratory-based study reveals similar peptide preferences for                 Pseudoalteromonadaceae                 , while                 Alteromonadaceae                 , for example, grew well in the lab on many substrates but dominated in seawater samples only when disaccharides were added. We further demonstrate a potential correlation between the genetic capacity for degrading amino sugars and the dominance of specific clades in these treatments. These results highlight the diversity in DOM utilization among heterotrophic bacteria and complexities in the response of natural communities.                                                        IMPORTANCE               A major goal of microbial ecology is to predict the dynamics of natural communities based on the identity of the organisms, their physiological traits, and their genomes. Our results show that several clades of heterotrophic bacteria each grow in response to one or more specific classes of organic matter.

  abstract = {Abstract             Marine protists and their metabolic activities are intricately tied to the cycling of nutrients and the flow of energy through microbial food webs. Physiochemical changes in the environment, such as those that result from mesoscale eddies, may impact protistan communities, but the effects that such changes have on protists are poorly known. A metatranscriptomic study was conducted to investigate how eddies affected protists at adjacent cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy sites in the oligotrophic ocean at four depths from 25 to 250\,m. Eddy polarity impacted protists at all depths sampled, although the effects of eddy polarity were secondary to the impact of depth across the depth range. Eddy-induced vertical shifts in the water column yielded differences in the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddy protistan communities, and these differences were the most pronounced at and just below the deep chlorophyll maximum. An analysis of transcripts associated with protistan nutritional physiology at 150\,m revealed that cyclonic eddies may support a more heterotrophic community, while anticyclonic eddies promote a more phototrophic community. The results of this study indicate that eddies alter the metabolism of protists particularly in the lower euphotic zone and may therefore impact carbon export from the euphotic zone.},

We evaluated the potential for abrupt increases in inorganic N sources to induce cascading effects on dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbial communities in the surface ocean. We collected water from 5 m depth in the central North Pacific and amended duplicate 20 liter polycarbonate carboys with nitrate or ammonium, tracking planktonic carbon fixation, DOM production, DOM composition and microbial community structure responses over 1 week relative to controls. Both nitrogen sources stimulated bulk phytoplankton, bacterial and DOM production and enriched               Synechococcus               and Flavobacteriaceae; ammonium enriched for oligotrophic Actinobacteria OM1 and Gammaproteobacteria KI89A clades while nitrate enriched Gammaproteobacteria SAR86, SAR92 and OM60 clades. DOM resulting from both N enrichments was more labile and stimulated growth of copiotrophic Gammaproteobacteria (Alteromonadaceae and Oceanospirillaceae) and Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacteraceae and Hyphomonadaceae) in weeklong dark incubations relative to controls. Our study illustrates how nitrogen pulses may have direct and cascading effects on DOM composition and microbial community dynamics in the open ocean.},

Phytoplankton acclimate to changing environmental conditions by a complex reallocation of carbon and energy through metabolic pathways to optimize growth. Considering the tremendous diversity of phytoplankton, it is not surprising that different phytoplankton taxa use different strategies to partition carbon and energy resources. It has therefore been satisfying to discover that general principles of energetic stoichiometry appear to govern these complex processes and can be broadly applied to interpret phytoplankton distributions, productivity, and food web dynamics. The expectation of future changes in aquatic environments brought on by climate change warrants gathering knowledge about underlying patterns of photosynthetic energy allocation and their impacts on community structure and ecosystem productivity.},

In animals and humans, lines of data have proved that Asp is indispensable for cell proliferation. However, in plants, despite the extensive study of the Asp family amino acid pathway, little attention has been paid to the function of Asp through the other numerous pathways. This review aims to elucidate the most important aspects of Asp in plants, from biosynthesis to catabolism and the role of Asp and its metabolic derivatives in response to changing environmental conditions. It considers the distribution of Asp in various cell compartments and the change of Asp level, and its significance in the whole plant under various stresses. Moreover, it provides evidence of the interconnection between Asp and phytohormones, which have prominent functions in plant growth, development, and defense. The updated information will help improve our understanding of the physiological role of Asp and Asp-borne metabolic fluxes, supporting the modular operation of these networks.},

Eukaryotic phytoplankton (e.g., diatoms), despite their relatively low abundance in oligotrophic waters, are responsible for a large component of the organic matter flux to the ocean interior. Mesoscale eddies can impact both microbial community structure and function, enhancing primary production and carbon export, but the mechanisms that underpin these dynamics are still poorly understood. Here, mesoscale eddy influences on the taxonomic diversity and expressed functional profiles of surface communities of microeukaryotes and particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria from the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre were assessed over 2\,years (spring 2016 and summer 2017). The taxonomic diversity of the microeukaryotes significantly differed by eddy polarity (cyclonic versus anticyclonic) and between sampling seasons/years and was significantly correlated with the taxonomic diversity of particle-associated heterotrophic bacteria. The expressed functional profile of these taxonomically distinct microeukaryotes varied consistently as a function of eddy polarity, with cyclones having a different expression pattern than anticyclones, and between sampling seasons/years. These data suggest that mesoscale forcing, and associated changes in biogeochemistry, could drive specific physiological responses in the resident microeukaryote community, independent of species composition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In stratified oligotrophic waters, phytoplankton communities forming the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) are isolated from atmospheric iron sources above and remineralized iron sources below. Reduced supply leads to a minimum in dissolved iron (dFe) near 100~m, but it is unclear if iron limits growth at the DCM. Here, we propose that natural iron addition events occur regularly with the passage of mesoscale eddies, which alter the supply of dFe and other nutrients relative to the availability of light, and can be used to test for iron limitation at the DCM. This framework is applied to two eddies sampled in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. Observations in an anticyclonic eddy center indicated downwelling of iron-rich surface waters, leading to increased dFe at the DCM but no increase in productivity. In contrast, uplift of isopycnals within a cyclonic eddy center increased supply of both nitrate and dFe to the DCM, and led to dominance of picoeukaryotic phytoplankton. Iron addition experiments did not increase productivity in either eddy, but significant enhancement of leucine incorporation in the light was observed in the cyclonic eddy, a potential indicator of iron stress among               Prochlorococcus               . Rapid cycling of siderophores and low dFe:nitrate uptake ratios also indicate that a portion of the microbial community was stressed by low iron. However, near-complete nitrate drawdown in this eddy, which represents an extreme case in nutrient supply compared to nearby Hawaii Ocean Time-series observations, suggests that recycling of dFe in oligotrophic ecosystems is sufficient to avoid iron limitation in the DCM under typical conditions.                        ,              Key Points                                                                Both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies add iron to the lower euphotic zone of oligotrophic gyres                                                     In an anticyclonic eddy, dissolved iron at the deep chlorophyll maximum increased but productivity did not                                                     Uptake of upwelled iron and nitrate in a cyclonic eddy led to low iron conditions and stress, but did not limit productivity},

Yet not all key producers of cobalamin have been identified in the ocean. We show that in the marine environment, select heterotrophic bacteria and Thaumarchaeota produce cobalamin, while Cyanobacteria, the most abundant phytoplankton on earth, supply and use pseudocobalamin. These chemically distinct cofactors support different members of the microbial community because they are not interchangeable as cofactors in enzymes. Our findings identify key organisms supporting cobalamin-based interdependencies that underpin primary production and microbial interactions in the ocean.                        ,                             Organisms within all domains of life require the cofactor cobalamin (vitamin B               12               ), which is produced only by a subset of bacteria and archaea. On the basis of genomic analyses, cobalamin biosynthesis in marine systems has been inferred in three main groups: select heterotrophic Proteobacteria, chemoautotrophic Thaumarchaeota, and photoautotrophic Cyanobacteria. Culture work demonstrates that many Cyanobacteria do not synthesize cobalamin but rather produce pseudocobalamin, challenging the connection between the occurrence of cobalamin biosynthesis genes and production of the compound in marine ecosystems. Here we show that cobalamin and pseudocobalamin coexist in the surface ocean, have distinct microbial sources, and support different enzymatic demands. Even in the presence of cobalamin, Cyanobacteria synthesize pseudocobalamin---likely reflecting their retention of an oxygen-independent pathway to produce pseudocobalamin, which is used as a cofactor in their specialized methionine synthase (MetH). This contrasts a model diatom,               Thalassiosira pseudonana               , which transported pseudocobalamin into the cell but was unable to use pseudocobalamin in its homolog of MetH. Our genomic and culture analyses showed that marine Thaumarchaeota and select heterotrophic bacteria produce cobalamin. This indicates that cobalamin in the surface ocean is a result of de novo synthesis by heterotrophic bacteria or via modification of closely related compounds like cyanobacterially produced pseudocobalamin. Deeper in the water column, our study implicates Thaumarchaeota as major producers of cobalamin based on genomic potential, cobalamin cell quotas, and abundance. Together, these findings establish the distinctive roles played by abundant prokaryotes in cobalamin-based microbial interdependencies that sustain community structure and function in the ocean.},

The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop.           ,              ABSTRACT                            Phytoplankton transform inorganic carbon into thousands of biomolecules that represent an important pool of fixed carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in the surface ocean. Metabolite production differs between phytoplankton, and the flux of these molecules through the microbial food web depends on compound-specific bioavailability to members of a wider microbial community. Yet relatively little is known about the diversity or concentration of metabolites within marine plankton. Here, we compare 313 polar metabolites in 21 cultured phytoplankton species and in natural planktonic communities across environmental gradients to show that bulk community metabolomes reflect the chemical composition of the phytoplankton community. We also show that groups of compounds have similar patterns across space and taxonomy, suggesting that the concentrations of these compounds in the environment are controlled by similar sources and sinks. We quantify several compounds in the surface ocean that represent substantial understudied pools of labile carbon. For example, the N-containing metabolite homarine was up to 3\% of particulate carbon and is produced in high concentrations by cultured               Synechococcus               , and S-containing gonyol accumulated up to 2.5\,nM in surface particles and likely originates from dinoflagellates or haptophytes. Our results show that phytoplankton composition directly shapes the carbon composition of the surface ocean. Our findings suggest that in order to access these pools of bioavailable carbon, the wider microbial community must be adapted to phytoplankton community composition.                                         IMPORTANCE               Microscopic phytoplankton transform 100 million tons of inorganic carbon into thousands of different organic compounds each day. The structure of each chemical is critical to its biological and ecosystem function, yet the diversity of biomolecules produced by marine microbial communities remained mainly unexplored, especially small polar molecules which are often considered the currency of the microbial loop. Here, we explore the abundance and diversity of small biomolecules in planktonic communities across ecological gradients in the North Pacific and within 21 cultured phytoplankton species. Our work demonstrates that phytoplankton diversity is an important determinant of the chemical composition of the highly bioavailable pool of organic carbon in the ocean, and we highlight understudied yet abundant compounds in both the environment and cultured organisms. These findings add to understanding of how the chemical makeup of phytoplankton shapes marine microbial communities where the ability to sense and use biomolecules depends on the chemical structure.},

A grand challenge is to use these data to improve predictive models and use models to explain observed patterns. This article presents a framework that aligns observations and models along the dimension of abstraction or biological organization---from raw sequences to ecosystem patterns for observations, and from sequence simulators to ecological theory for models. It then reviews 16 studies that compared model results with molecular observations. Molecular data can and are being combined with microbial ecosystem models, but to keep up with and take advantage of the full scope of observations, models need to become more mechanistically detailed and complex, which is a technical and cultural challenge for the ecological modeling community.},

Novel microwave-assisted vapor phase and liquid phase hydrolyses with HCl (6 mol L               -1               ) were developed for the analysis of nucleobases in soluble and particulate samples, respectively.

Residual hydrochloric acid in hydrolysate can be removed easily by drying under a stream of nitrogen gas. Nucleobases were separated and quantified using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The limit of detection for primary nucleobases ranged from 20 to 32 nmol L               -1               . Total hydrolysable nucleobases were analyzed in salmon testes DNA, yeast RNA, cultures of marine microalgae and cyanobacteria, and suspended particles from an estuary.

Sinking particles are important for carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere and its movement to the deep ocean. They also feed life below the ocean's productive surface and sustain life in the deep sea, in addition to depositing organic matter on the seafloor. However, the magnitude of all of these processes is dependent on the transformation of sinking particles during their journey through the water column. This review focuses on the movement of organic matter from the surface ocean to the deep sea via the biological carbon pump and examines the processes that prevent this downward movement---namely, attenuation via microbial colonization and zooplankton feeding. It also discusses how the depth-specific interactions among microbes, zooplankton, and aggregates determine carbon export as well as nutrient recycling, which in turn impact ocean production and Earth's climate.},

The ability to interrogate these rich datasets is handicapped by the limited capability and flexibility of existing software. We introduce the Mass Spec Query Language (MassQL) that addresses these issues by enabling an expressive set of mass spectrometry patterns to be queried directly from raw data. MassQL is an open-source mass spectrometry query language for flexible and mass spectrometer manufacturer-independent mining of MS data. We envision the flexibility, scalability, and ease of use of MassQL will empower the mass spectrometry community to take fuller advantage of their mass spectrometry data and accelerate discoveries.},

Metabolomics has been used in biomedical applications as well as environmental studies that explore ecological and biogeochemical questions. We have developed a targeted metabolomics method using electrospray ionization--liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to analyze metabolites dissolved in seawater. Preparation of samples from the marine environment presents challenges because dilute metabolites must be concentrated and desalted. We present the extraction efficiencies of 89 metabolites in our targeted method using solid phase extraction (SPE). In addition, we calculate the limits of detection and quantification for the metabolites in the method and compare the instrument response factors in five different matrices ranging from deionized water to spent medium from cultured marine microbes. High background organic matter content reduces the instrument response factor for only a small group of metabolites, yet enhances the extraction efficiency for other metabolites on the SPE cartridge used here, a modified styrene-divinylbenzene polymer called PPL. Aromatic or larger uncharged compounds, in particular, are reproducibly well retained on the PPL polymer. This method is suitable for the detection of dissolved metabolites in marine samples, with limits of detection ranging from\,{$<$}\,1 pM to {$\sim$} 2 nM dependent on the dual impacts of seawater matrix on extraction efficiency and on instrument response factors.},

The combination of the surface ocean food web that produces these particles and the particle-associated microbial community that degrades them creates a complex set of variables that control organic matter cycling. We use targeted metabolomics to characterize a suite of small biomolecules, or metabolites, in sinking particles and compare their metabolite composition to that of the suspended particles in the euphotic zone from which they are likely derived. These samples were collected in the South Atlantic subtropical gyre, as well as in the equatorial Atlantic region and the Amazon River plume. The composition of targeted metabolites in the sinking particles was relatively similar throughout the transect, despite the distinct oceanic regions in which they were generated. Metabolites possibly derived from the degradation of nucleic acids and lipids, such as xanthine and glycine betaine, were an increased mole fraction of the targeted metabolites in the sinking particles relative to surface suspended particles, while algal-derived metabolites like the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate were a smaller fraction of the observed metabolites on the sinking particles. These compositional changes are shaped both by the removal of metabolites associated with detritus delivered from the surface ocean and by production of metabolites by the sinking particle-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, they provide a basis for examining the types and quantities of metabolites that may be delivered to the deep sea by sinking particles.},

They are an essential currency in interactions at the population and community levels of biological organization. Characterizing metabolite distributions inside microbial cells and dissolved in seawater is essential to understanding the controls on their production and fate, as well as their roles in shaping marine microbial food webs. Here, we apply a targeted metabolomics method to quantify particulate and dissolved distributions of a suite of biologically relevant metabolites including vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, osmolytes, and intermediates in biosynthetic pathways along a latitudinal transect in the western Atlantic Ocean. We find that, in the upper 200\,m of the water column, most particulate or intracellular metabolites positively covary with the most abundant microbial taxa. In contrast, dissolved metabolites exhibited greater variability with differences in distribution between ocean regions. Although fewer particulate metabolites were detected below 200\,m, the particulate metabolites identified in the deep ocean may be linked to adaptive physiological strategies of deep-sea microbes. Based on the identified metabolite distributions, we propose relationships between certain metabolites and microbial populations, and find that dissolved metabolite distributions are not directly related to their particulate abundances.},

Significant progress has been made in studying these effects and expanding our understanding of microbial stoichiometry. However, the `black box' has not been completely cracked open; there remain gaps in our knowledge of the fate of elements within the phytoplankton cell, and the effect of external processes on nutrient fluxes through their metabolism and into macromolecules and biomass - the eponymous `gray box'. In this review paper, we describe the development of an integrative modeling approach that involves a stoichiometrically explicit model of Macromolecular Allocation and Genome-scale Metabolic Analysis (MAGMA) to gain insights into the intra- and extracellular fluxes of nutrients using the cyanobacterium               Parasynechococcus marenigrum               WH8102 as a target model organism. We then describe an example of the genome-scale resources for               P. marenigrum               that can be used to build such an integrated modeling tool to see through the gray box of phytoplankton stoichiometry and improve our understanding of the effects of resource supplies and other environmental drivers, especially temperature, on C:N:P demand, acquisition, and allocation at the cellular level.},

In this work, we used isotope labeling to directly quantify uptake of complex carbon pools from the two primary sources of marine organic carbon (diatoms and cyanobacteria) by a natural microbial community. Our data show that carbon pools are partitioned into distinct microbial lineages whose physiological properties and resource acquisition strategies match the chemical nature of their preferred substrates. Our results provide ecological and functional insights into the patterns of microbial community structure changes that occur during marine phytoplankton blooms.           ,                             Blooms of marine phytoplankton fix complex pools of dissolved organic matter (DOM) that are thought to be partitioned among hundreds of heterotrophic microbes at the base of the food web. While the relationship between microbial consumers and phytoplankton DOM is a key component of marine carbon cycling, microbial loop metabolism is largely understood from model organisms and substrates. Here, we took an untargeted approach to measure and analyze partitioning of four distinct phytoplankton-derived DOM pools among heterotrophic populations in a natural microbial community using a combination of ecogenomics, stable isotope probing (SIP), and proteomics. Each               13               C-labeled exudate or lysate from a diatom or a picocyanobacterium was preferentially assimilated by different heterotrophic taxa with specialized metabolic and physiological adaptations. Bacteroidetes populations, with their unique high-molecular-weight transporters, were superior competitors for DOM derived from diatom cell lysis, rapidly increasing growth rates and ribosomal protein expression to produce new relatively high C:N biomass. Proteobacteria responses varied, with relatively low levels of assimilation by Gammaproteobacteria populations, while copiotrophic Alphaproteobacteria such as the Roseobacter clade, with their diverse array of ABC- and TRAP-type transporters to scavenge monomers and nitrogen-rich metabolites, accounted for nearly all cyanobacteria exudate assimilation and produced new relatively low C:N biomass. Carbon assimilation rates calculated from SIP data show that exudate and lysate from two common marine phytoplankton are being used by taxonomically distinct sets of heterotrophic populations with unique metabolic adaptations, providing a deeper mechanistic understanding of consumer succession and carbon use during marine bloom events.*},

Among the tools used for metabolomic research, mass spectrometry is one of the most powerful tools. However, metabolomics by mass spectrometry always reveals a high number of unknown compounds which complicate in depth mechanistic or biochemical understanding. In principle, mass spectrometry can be utilized within strategies of                 de novo                 structure elucidation of small molecules, starting with the computation of the elemental composition of an unknown metabolite using accurate masses with errors {$<$}5 ppm (parts per million). However even with very high mass accuracy ({$<$}1 ppm) many chemically possible formulae are obtained in higher mass regions. In automatic routines an additional orthogonal filter therefore needs to be applied in order to reduce the number of potential elemental compositions. This report demonstrates the necessity of isotope abundance information by mathematical confirmation of the concept.                                                        Results                                High mass accuracy ({$<$}1 ppm) alone is not enough to exclude enough candidates with complex elemental compositions (C, H, N, S, O, P, and potentially F, Cl, Br and Si). Use of isotopic abundance patterns as a single further constraint removes {$>$}95\% of false candidates. This orthogonal filter can condense several thousand candidates down to only a small number of molecular formulas. Example calculations for 10, 5, 3, 1 and 0.1 ppm mass accuracy are given. Corresponding software scripts can be downloaded from                 http://fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu                 . A comparison of eight chemical databases revealed that PubChem and the Dictionary of Natural Products can be recommended for automatic queries using molecular formulae.                                                        Conclusion               More than 1.6 million molecular formulae in the range 0--500 Da were generated in an exhaustive manner under strict observation of mathematical and chemical rules. Assuming that ion species are fully resolved (either by chromatography or by high resolution mass spectrometry), we conclude that a mass spectrometer capable of 3 ppm mass accuracy and 2\% error for isotopic abundance patterns outperforms mass spectrometers with less than 1 ppm mass accuracy or even hypothetical mass spectrometers with 0.1 ppm mass accuracy that do not include isotope information in the calculation of molecular formulae.},

Growth rates at the community level are constrained by biomass and trophic interactions among bacteria, phytoplankton, and their grazers. Phytoplankton growth rates are approximately 1 d-1, whereas most heterotrophic bacteria grow slowly, close to 0.1 d-1; only a few taxa can grow ten times as fast. Data from 16S rRNA and other approaches are used to speculate about the growth rate and the life history strategy of SAR11, the most abundant clade of heterotrophic bacteria in the oceans. These strategies are also explored using genomic data. Although the methods and data are imperfect, the available data can be used to set limits on growth rates and thus on the timescale for changes in the composition and structure of microbial communities.},

Stable-labelled isotopes and metabolomics were employed to address the influence of nitrate, ammonium, and urea on cellular physiology and production of microcystins in               Microcystis aeruginosa               NIES-843. Global metabolic changes were driven by both N speciation and diel cycling. Tracing               15               N-labelled nitrate, ammonium, and urea through the metabolome revealed N uptake, regardless of species, was linked to C assimilation. The production of amino acids, like arginine, and other N-rich compounds corresponded with greater turnover of microcystins in cells grown on urea compared to nitrate and ammonium. However,               15               N was incorporated into microcystins from all N sources. The differences in N flux were attributed to the energetic efficiency of growth on each N source. While N in general plays an important role in sustaining biomass, these data show that N-speciation induces physiological changes that culminate in differences in global metabolism, cellular microcystin quotas and congener composition.},

Viruses are key players in controlling algal demise, thereby diverting biomass from higher trophic levels to the DOM pool, a process termed the ``viral shunt.'' To decode the metabolic footprint of the viral shunt in the environment, we induced a bloom of               Emiliania huxleyi               and followed its succession using untargeted exometabolomics. We show that bloom succession induces dynamic changes in the exometabolic landscape. We found a set of chlorine-iodine--containing metabolites that were induced by viral infection and released during bloom demise. These metabolites were further detected in virus-infected oceanic               E. huxleyi               blooms. Therefore, we propose that halogenation with both chlorine and iodine is a distinct hallmark of the virus-induced DOM of               E. huxleyi               , providing insights into the metabolic consequences of the viral shunt.},

We quantified the relative abundances of monophosphate nucleotides and their corresponding nucleosides, using a combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics methods. Under P-deficient conditions, we observed a marked decrease in adenosine 5{$\prime$}-monophosphate (AMP) with a concomitant increase in adenosine. This shift occurred within all detected pairs of monophosphate nucleotides and nucleosides, and was consistent with previous work showing transcriptional changes in nucleotide synthesis and salvage under P-deficient conditions for model eukaryotes. In the field, we observed AMP-to-adenosine ratios that were similar to those in laboratory culture under P-deficient conditions.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The euphotic zone of the surface ocean contains distinct physical-chemical regimes that vary in light and nutrient concentrations as an inverse function of depth. The most numerous phytoplankter of the mid- and low-latitude ocean is the picocyanobacterium               Prochlorococcus               , which consists of ecologically distinct subpopulations (i.e., ``ecotypes''). Ecotypes have different temperature, light, and nutrient optima and display distinct relative abundances along gradients of these niche dimensions. As a primary producer,               Prochlorococcus               fixes and releases organic carbon to neighboring microbes as part of the microbial loop. However, little is known about the specific molecules               Prochlorococcus               accumulates and releases or how these processes vary among its ecotypes. Here, we characterize the metabolite diversity of               Prochlorococcus               by profiling three ecologically distinct cultured strains: MIT9301, representing a high-light-adapted ecotype dominating shallow tropical and sub-tropical waters; MIT0801, representing a low-light-adapted ecotype found throughout the euphotic zone; and MIT9313, representing a low-light-adapted ecotype relatively most abundant at the base of the euphotic zone. In both intracellular and extracellular metabolite profiles, we observe striking differences across strains in the accumulation and release of molecules, such as the DNA methylating agent S-adenosyl-methionine (intracellular) and the branched-chain amino acids (intracellular) and their precursors (extracellular). While some differences reflect variable genome content across the strains, others likely reflect variable regulation of conserved pathways. In the extracellular profiles, we identify molecules such as pantothenic acid and aromatic amino acids that may serve as currencies in               Prochlorococcus               ' interactions with neighboring microbes and, therefore, merit further investigation.                                         IMPORTANCE                                Approximately half of the annual carbon fixation on Earth occurs in the surface ocean through the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton such as the ubiquitous picocyanobacterium                 Prochlorococcus                 . Ecologically distinct subpopulations (or ecotypes) of                 Prochlorococcus                 are central conduits of organic substrates into the ocean microbiome, thus playing important roles in surface ocean production. We measured the chemical profile of three cultured ecotype strains, observing striking differences among them that have implications for the likely chemical impact of                 Prochlorococcus                 subpopulations on their surroundings in the wild. Subpopulations differ in abundance along gradients of temperature, light, and nutrient concentrations, suggesting that these chemical differences could affect carbon cycling in different ocean strata and should be considered in models of                 Prochlorococcus                 physiology and marine carbon dynamics.                                       ,                             Approximately half of the annual carbon fixation on Earth occurs in the surface ocean through the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton such as the ubiquitous picocyanobacterium               Prochlorococcus               .

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Chromatographic peakpicking continues to represent a significant bottleneck in automated LC--MS workflows. Uncontrolled false discovery rates and the lack of manually-calibrated quality metrics require researchers to visually evaluate individual peaks, requiring large amounts of time and breaking replicability. This problem is exacerbated in noisy environmental datasets and for novel separation methods such as hydrophilic interaction columns in metabolomics, creating a demand for a simple, intuitive, and robust metric of peak quality.                                         Results               Here, we manually labeled four HILIC oceanographic particulate metabolite datasets to assess the performance of individual peak quality metrics. We used these datasets to construct a predictive model calibrated to the likelihood that visual inspection by an MS expert would include a given mass feature in the downstream analysis. We implemented two novel peak quality metrics, a custom signal-to-noise metric and a test of similarity to a bell curve, both calculated from the raw data in the extracted ion chromatogram, and found that these outperformed existing measurements of peak quality. A simple logistic regression model built on two metrics reduced the fraction of false positives in the analysis from 70--80\% down to 1--5\% and showed minimal overfitting when applied to novel datasets. We then explored the implications of this quality thresholding on the conclusions obtained by the downstream analysis and found that while only 10\% of the variance in the dataset could be explained by depth in the default output from the peakpicker, approximately 40\% of the variance was explained when restricted to high-quality peaks alone.                                         Conclusions               We conclude that the poor performance of peakpicking algorithms significantly reduces the power of both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to detect environmental differences. We demonstrate that simple models built on intuitive metrics and derived from the raw data are more robust and can outperform more complex models when applied to new data. Finally, we show that in properly curated datasets, depth is a major driver of variability in the marine microbial metabolome and identify several interesting metabolite trends for future investigation.},

  abstract = {Mesoscale eddies significantly alter open ocean environments such as those found in the subtropical gyres that cover a large fraction of the global ocean. Previous studies have explored eddy effects on biogeochemistry and microbial community composition but not on the molecular composition of particulate organic matter. This study reports the absolute concentration of 67 metabolites and relative abundances for 640 molecular features, measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) following both targeted and untargeted approaches. This approach allowed us to better understand how mesoscale eddies impact the metabolome of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre during two cruises in 2017 and 2018. We find that many metabolites track biomass trends, but metabolites like isethionic acid, homarine, and trigonelline linked to eukaryotic phytoplankton were enriched at the deep chlorophyll maximum of the cyclonic features, while degradation products such as arsenobetaine were enriched in anticyclones. In every analysis, the metabolites with the strongest responses were identified using LC-MS through untargeted metabolomics approaches, highlighting that the molecules most sensitive to environmental perturbation were not among the previously characterized metabolome. By analyzing depth variability (accounting for 20-40\% of metabolomic variability across {\textasciitilde}150 meters) and the vertical displacement of isopycnal surfaces (explaining 10-20\% of variability across a sea level anomaly range of 40 centimeters and a spatial distance of 300 kilometers), this analysis constrains the importance of mesoscale eddies in shaping the chemical composition of particulate matter in the largest biomes on the planet.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The detrainment of organic matter from the mixed layer, a process known as the mixed layer pump (ML pump), has long been overlooked in carbon export budgets. Recently, the ML pump has been investigated at seasonal scale and appeared to contribute significantly to particulate organic carbon export to the mesopelagic zone, especially at high latitudes where seasonal variations of the mixed layer depth are large. However, the dynamics of the ML pump at intraseasonal scales remains poorly known, mainly because the lack of observational tools suited to studying such dynamics. In the present study, using a dense network of autonomous profiling floats equipped with bio-optical sensors, we captured widespread episodic ML pump-driven export events, during the winter and early spring period, in a large part of the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean. The intraseasonal dynamics of the ML pump exports fresh organic material to depth (basin-scale average up to 55~mg~C{$\cdot$}m               -2               {$\cdot$}day               -1               ), providing a significant source of energy to the mesopelagic food web before the spring bloom period.

  abstract = {The global ocean genome (the pool of genes in marine organisms and the functional information they encode) is a major, untapped resource for science and society with a growing range of biotechnology applications in sectors such as biomedicine, energy, and food. Shotgun sequencing and metagenomics can now be used to catalog the diversity of ocean microbial life and to explore its functional potential, but has been limited by sample coverage, access to suitable sequencing platforms, and computational capacity. Here we provide a novel synthesis of the global ocean genome based on analysis of 2,102 sampled ocean metagenomes, with gene assembly and annotation via the KAUST Metagenome Analysis Platform (KMAP) Global Ocean Gene Catalog 1.0 containing {\textasciitilde}317.5 million gene clusters. Taxonomically, we report the distribution of marine genes across the tree of life and different ocean basins and depth zone biomes. Functionally, we map its relationship to protein families and biogeochemical processes, including the major microbial metabolic pathways that process three elements that play fundamental roles in biogeochemical cycles and are relevant to climate change. These data extend our understanding of the complex, dynamic nature of the ocean microbiome and its metabolic capabilities. Further research is of critical global importance both to unlock the potential of the ocean genome and to understand and predict the effects of human-induced changes, including pollution and climate change. Further hypothesis-driven research should target under-sampled deep sea and benthic microbial communities using enhanced metagenomic methods, to better understand marine ecosystem functioning. Investment in the necessary computational capacity is essential, as are suitable intellectual property frameworks.},

How particulate organic carbon (POC) is transformed during export to the deep sea however is not well understood. Here, we report that dominant suspended prokaryotes also found in sinking particles serve as informative tracers of particle export processes. In a three-year time series from oceanographic campaigns in the Pacific Ocean, upper water column relative abundances of suspended prokaryotes entrained in sinking particles decreased exponentially from depths of 75 to 250\,m, conforming to known depth-attenuation patterns of carbon, energy, and mass fluxes in the epipelagic zone. Below {\textasciitilde}250\,m however, the relative abundance of suspended prokaryotes entrained in sinking particles increased with depth. These results indicate that microbial entrainment, colonization, and sinking particle formation are elevated at mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths. Comparison of suspended and sinking particle-associated microbes provides information about the depth-variability of POC export and biotic processes, that is not evident from biogeochemical data alone.},

Here we use a transcriptomic approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms associated with temperature acclimation and adaptation in closely related colder- and warmer-adapted diatom species. We find evidence that evolutionary changes in baseline gene expression, which we termed transcriptional investment or divestment, is a key mechanism used by diatoms to adapt to different growth temperatures. Invested and divested pathways indicate that the maintenance of protein processing machinery and membrane structure, important short-term physiological mechanisms used to respond to temperature changes, are key elements associated with adaptation to different growth temperatures. Our results also indicate that evolutionary changes in the transcriptional regulation of acetyl-CoA associated pathways, including lipid and branched chain amino acid metabolism, are used by diatoms to balance photosynthetic light capture and metabolism with changes in growth temperature. Transcriptional investment and divestment can provide a framework to identify mechanisms of acclimation and adaption to temperature.},

Cells grown on either adenine or guanine were able to take up both purines, although the adenine uptake rate was always about 40\% of the guanine uptake rate. Both adenine and guanine were taken up by an inducible system(s) exhibiting hyperbolic kinetics with identical apparent A, values of 3-2 mmol m               -3               for adenine and 3-2mmol m               -3               for guanine. Adenine and guanine utilization depended on pH, with similar optimal pH values of 7{$\cdot$}3 and 7{$\cdot$}4, respectively. Adenine and guanine each acted as a competitive inhibitor of the other's uptake, and their utilization was also inhibited by hypoxanthine, xanthine and urate. Inhibition of adenine uptake by guanine and hypoxanthine was competitive, with A{$\prime$}, values of 5{$\cdot$}5 and 1. 6 mmol m               -3               respectively.

Utilization of both adenine and guanine was inhibited by cyanide, azide, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethyl urea, 2,4-dinitrophenol and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and was also sensitive to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and N-ethyl-maleimide.

Here we present direct measurements of cellular nutrient content and stoichiometric ratios for discrete phytoplankton populations spanning broad environmental conditions across several ocean basins. Median cellular carbon-to-phosphorus and nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios were positively correlated with vertical nitrate-to-phosphate flux for all phytoplankton groups and were consistently higher for cyanobacteria than eukaryotes. Light and temperature were inconsistent predictors of stoichiometric ratios. Across nutrient-rich and phosphorus-stressed biomes in the North Atlantic, but not in the nitrogen-stressed tropical North Pacific, we find that a combination of taxonomic composition and environmental acclimation best predict bulk particulate organic matter composition. Our findings demonstrate the central role of plankton biodiversity and plasticity in controlling linkages between ocean nutrient and carbon cycles in some regions.},

Beyond the widely-used open format mzML, near-lossless or lossless compression algorithms and formats emerged in scenarios with different precision requirements. The data precision is often related to the instrument and subsequent processing algorithms. Unlike storage-oriented formats, which focus more on lossless compression rate, computation-oriented formats concentrate as much on decoding speed as the compression rate.                                         Results                                Here we introduce ``Aird'', an opensource and computation-oriented format with controllable precision, flexible indexing strategies, and high compression rate. Aird provides a novel compressor called Zlib-Diff-PforDelta (ZDPD) for m/z data. Compared with Zlib only, m/z data size is about 55\% lower in Aird average. With the high-speed decoding and encoding performance of the single instruction multiple data technology used in the ZDPD, Aird merely takes 33\% decoding time compared with Zlib. We have downloaded seven datasets from ProteomeXchange and Metabolights. They are from different SCIEX, Thermo, and Agilent instruments. Then we convert the raw data into mzML, mgf, and mz5 file formats by MSConvert and compare them with Aird format. Aird uses JavaScript Object Notation for metadata storage. Aird-SDK is written in Java, and AirdPro is a GUI client for vendor file converting written in C\#. They are freely available at                 https://github.com/CSi-Studio/Aird-SDK                 and                 https://github.com/CSi-Studio/AirdPro                 .                                                        Conclusions               With the innovation of MS acquisition mode, MS data characteristics are also constantly changing. New data features can bring more effective compression methods and new index modes to achieve high search performance. The MS data storage mode will also become professional and customized. ZDPD uses multiple MS digital features, and researchers also can use it in other formats like mzML. Aird is designed to become a computing-oriented data format with high scalability, compression rate, and fast decoding speed.},

They can support vertical velocities as large as 100 m d               -1               and play a crucial role in transporting nutrients into the sunlit ocean for phytoplankton production. In regimes with deep surface mixed layers, submesoscale instabilities can cause stratification within days, thereby increasing light exposure for phytoplankton trapped close to the surface. These instabilities help to create and maintain localized environments that favor the growth of phytoplankton, contribute to productivity, and cause enormous heterogeneity in the abundance of phytoplankton, which has implications for interactions within the ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Phytoplankton size structure controls the trophic organization of planktonic communities and their ability to export biogenic materials toward the ocean's interior. Our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the variability in phytoplankton size structure has been shaped by the assumption that the pace of metabolism decreases allometrically with increasing cell size. However, recent field and laboratory evidence indicates that biomassspecific production and growth rates are similar in both small and large cells but peak at intermediate cell sizes. The maximum nutrient uptake rate scales isometrically with cell volume and superisometrically with the minimum nutrient quota. The unimodal size scaling of phytoplankton growth arises from ataxonomic, size-dependent trade-off processes related to nutrient requirement, acquisition, and use. The superior ability of intermediate-size cells to exploit high nutrient concentrations explains their biomass dominance during blooms. Biogeographic patterns in phytoplankton size structure and growth rate are independent of temperature and driven mainly by changes in resource supply.},

Here we show that although all taxa undergo large, near daily fluctuations in abundance, microbial plankton are organized into clearly defined communities whose turnover is rapid and sharp. We analyze a time series of 93 consecutive days of coastal plankton using a technique that allows inference of communities as modular units of interacting taxa by determining positive and negative correlations at different temporal frequencies. This approach shows both coordinated population expansions that demarcate community boundaries and high frequency of positive and negative associations among populations within communities. Our analysis thus highlights that the environmental variability of the coastal ocean is mirrored in sharp transitions of defined but ephemeral communities of organisms.},

The inability to assimilate nitrate is considered an important factor underlying the distribution of               Prochlorococcus               , and thought to explain, in part, low abundance of               Prochlorococcus               in coastal, temperate, and upwelling zones. Here, we describe the widespread occurrence of a genomic island containing nitrite and nitrate assimilation genes in uncultured               Prochlorococcus               cells from marine surface waters. These genes are characterized by low GC content, form a separate phylogenetic clade most closely related to marine               Synechococcus               , and are located in a different genomic region compared with an orthologous cluster found in marine               Synechococcus               strains. This sequence distinction suggests that these genes were not transferred recently from               Synechococcus               . We demonstrate that the nitrogen assimilation genes encode functional proteins and are expressed in the ocean. Also, we find that their relative occurrence is higher in the Caribbean Sea and Indian Ocean compared with the Sargasso Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, which may be related to the nitrogen availability in each region. Our data suggest that the ability to assimilate nitrite and nitrate is associated with microdiverse lineages within high- and low-light (LL) adapted               Prochlorococcus               ecotypes. It challenges 2 long-held assumptions that (               i               )               Prochlorococcus               cannot assimilate nitrate, and (               ii               ) only LL adapted ecotypes can use nitrite. The potential for previously unrecognized productivity by               Prochlorococcus               in the presence of oxidized nitrogen species has implications for understanding the biogeography of               Prochlorococcus               and its role in the oceanic carbon and nitrogen cycles.},

Here, we show that altering the bacterial composition of two widespread Symbiodiniaceae species, during their free-living stage, results in a significant shift in their cellular metabolism. Indeed, the abundance of monosaccharides and the key phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) were correlated with the presence of specific bacteria, including members of the               Labrenzia               (               Roseibium               ) and               Marinobacter               genera.

Bacterial catabolism of these substrates can then lead to the production of climate active trace gases such as methylamine and methane. Using radiotracers, we investigated prokaryotic choline/GBT uptake and determined biotic and abiotic factors driving these processes in the Western English Channel, UK. Kinetic uptake parameters indicated high affinity (nM range) for both osmolytes and showed a seasonal pattern for choline uptake. Generalized linear modeling of uptake parameters suggested a significant influence of sea surface temperature and salinity on prokaryotic uptake of both osmolytes. The presence of diatoms significantly influenced prokaryotic choline/GBT uptake dynamics. Choline uptake was further related to the occurrence of               Phaeocystis               spp., which were highly abundant in the phytoplankton community during spring, and dinoflagellates abundance during summer. While Rhodobacteraceae were the most important bacterial drivers for prokaryotic choline uptake, prokaryotic GBT uptake was associated with various groups such as SAR11 (Pelagibacterales) and Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting a wider capacity for GBT catabolism than previously recognized. Furthermore, using a newly developed approach we determined the first available data for dissolved GBT concentrations in seawater and found both osmolytes to be at the sub-nanomolar range. Together, this study improves our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of these environmentally important osmolytes and highlights how their cycles may be affected by a changing climate.},

  abstract = {The production and consumption of organic matter by marine organisms plays a central role in the marine carbon cycle. Labile organic compounds (metabolites) are the major currency of energetic demands and organismal interaction, but these compounds remain elusive because of their rapid turnover and concomitant minuscule concentrations in the dissolved organic matter pool. Organic osmolytes are a group of small metabolites synthesized at high intracellular concentrations (mM) to regulate cellular osmolarity and have the potential to be released as abundant dissolved substrates. Osmolytes may represent an essential currency of exchange among heterotrophic prokaryotes and primary and secondary producers in marine food webs. For example, the well-known metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is used as an osmolyte by some phytoplankton and can be subsequently metabolized by 60\% of the marine bacterial community, supplying up to 13\% of the bacterial carbon demand and 100\% of the bacterial sulfur demand. While marine osmolytes have been studied for decades, our understanding of their cycling and significance within microbial communities is still far from comprehensive. Here, we surveyed the genes responsible for synthesis, breakdown, and transport of 14 key osmolytes. We systematically searched for these genes across marine bacterial genomes (               n               = 897) and protistan transcriptomes (               n               = 652) using homologous protein profiles to investigate the potential for osmolyte metabolisms. Using the pattern of gene presence and absence, we infer the metabolic potential of surveyed microbes to interact with each osmolyte. Specifically, we identify: (1) complete pathways for osmolyte synthesis in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic marine microbes, (2) microbes capable of transporting osmolytes but lacking complete synthesis and/or breakdown pathways, and (3) osmolytes whose synthesis and/or breakdown appears to be specialized and is limited to a subset of organisms. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the marine microbial loop has the genetic potential to actively recycle osmolytes and that this abundant group of small metabolites may function as a significant source of nutrients through exchange among diverse microbial groups that significantly contribute to the cycling of labile carbon.},

Furthermore, mechanisms and sites of N uptake and storage have not been fully determined. We show that crystalline guanine (C               5               H               5               N               5               O) is an important N storage form for phytoplankton and for symbiotic dinoflagellates of corals. The widespread occurrence of guanine reserves among taxonomically distant microalgal species suggests an early evolutionary origin of its function as N storage. Crystalline guanine appears to be a multifunctional biochemical with an important role in the N cycle that remains to be elucidated. In particular, a better knowledge of N-storage metabolism is necessary to understand the impact of eutrophication on coral-symbiont interaction.                        ,                             Nitrogen (N) is an essential macronutrient for microalgae, influencing their productivity, composition, and growth dynamics. Despite the dramatic consequences of N starvation, many free-living and endosymbiotic microalgae thrive in N-poor and N-fluctuating environments, giving rise to questions about the existence and nature of their long-term N reserves. Our understanding of these processes requires a unequivocal identification of the N reserves in microalgal cells as well as their turnover kinetics and subcellular localization. Herein, we identified crystalline guanine as the enigmatic large-capacity and rapid-turnover N reserve of microalgae. The identification was unambiguously supported by confocal Raman, fluorescence, and analytical transmission electron microscopies as well as stable isotope labeling. We discovered that the storing capacity for crystalline guanine by the marine dinoflagellate               Amphidinium               carterae               was sufficient to support N requirements for several new generations. We determined that N reserves were rapidly accumulated from guanine available in the environment as well as biosynthesized from various N-containing nutrients. Storage of exogenic N in the form of crystalline guanine was found broadly distributed across taxonomically distant groups of microalgae from diverse habitats, from freshwater and marine free-living forms to endosymbiotic microalgae of reef-building corals (               Acropora millepora               ,               Euphyllia paraancora               ). We propose that crystalline guanine is the elusive N depot that mitigates the negative consequences of episodic N shortage. Guanine (C               5               H               5               N               5               O) may act similarly to cyanophycin (C               10               H               19               N               5               O               5               ) granules in cyanobacteria.

The niche partitioning by different               Prochlorococcus               ecotypes begs the question of whether they also differ in their nitrogen (N) utilization physiology, especially with respect to NO               3               -               utilization. To explore this possibility, we studied the capabilities of different               Prochlorococcus               and               Synechococcus               strains to grow on a variety of N sources. We found that all the isolates grew well on NH               4               +               and all were capable of urea utilization, occasionally at a lower growth rate. None of the               Prochlorococcus               isolates were able to grow with NO               3               -               . Four high-B/A               Prochlorococcus               isolates grew on NO               3               -               , but all others did not. Whole genome analysis of the low-B/A               Prochlorococcus               MED4 revealed that the genes required for NO uptake and reduction were absent. The genome of the high-B/A               Prochlorococcus               MIT 9313 also lacked the NO               3               -               utilization genes but has homologs of genes required for NO               3               -               utilization consistent with its physiology and ecology. Thus, the utilization of different N sources in the marine environment is partitioned among closely related ecotypes, each with adaptations optimized for the environment where these sources are available.},

A vast number of compounds are present in DOM, and they play important roles in all major element cycles, contribute to the storage of atmospheric CO               2               in the ocean, support marine ecosystems, and facilitate interactions between organisms. At the heart of the DOM cycle lie molecular-level relationships between the individual compounds in DOM and the members of the ocean microbiome that produce and consume them. In the past, these connections have eluded clear definition because of the sheer numerical complexity of both DOM molecules and microorganisms. Emerging tools in analytical chemistry, microbiology, and informatics are breaking down the barriers to a fuller appreciation of these connections. Here we highlight questions being addressed using recent methodological and technological developments in those fields and consider how these advances are transforming our understanding of some of the most important reactions of the marine carbon cycle.},

The details of this important step in the global carbon cycle remain poorly resolved, largely due to the methodological challenges of studying a diverse pool of metabolites that are produced and consumed nearly simultaneously. In this perspective, a new compilation of published data builds on previous studies to obtain an updated estimate of the fraction of marine net primary production that passes through the labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. In agreement with previous studies, our data mining and modeling approaches hypothesize that about half of ocean net primary production is processed through the labile DOC pool. The fractional contributions from three major sources are estimated at 0.4 for living phytoplankton, 0.4 for dead and dying phytoplankton, and 0.2 for heterotrophic microbes and mesoplankton.},

Many models of ecological stoichiometry blend together acclimative and adaptive responses to environmental conditions. These two pathways can have unique molecular mechanisms and stoichiometric outcomes, and we attempt to disentangle the two processes. We find that interactions between environmental conditions and cellular growth are key to understanding stoichiometric regulation, but the growth rates of most marine plankton populations are poorly constrained. We propose that specific physiological mechanisms have a strong impact on plankton and community stoichiometry in nutrient-rich environments, whereas biogeochemical interactions are important for the stoichiometry of the oligotrophic gyres. Finally, we outline key areas with missing information that is needed to advance understanding of the present and future ecological stoichiometry of ocean plankton.},

While more and more algorithms and workflows become available to process a large number of non-targeted data sets, there still exist few manually evaluated universal test data sets for refining and evaluating these methods. The first step of non-targeted screening, peak detection and refinement of it is arguably the most important step for non-targeted screening. However, the absence of a model data set makes it harder for researchers to evaluate peak detection methods. In this Data Descriptor, we provide a manually checked data set consisting of 255,000 EICs (5000 peaks randomly sampled from across 51 samples) for the evaluation on peak detection and gap-filling algorithms. The data set was created from a previous real-world study, of which a subset was used to extract and manually classify ion chromatograms by three mass spectrometry experts. The data set consists of the converted mass spectrometry files, intermediate processing files and the central file containing a table with all important information for the classified peaks.}

Furthermore, marine picocyanobacteria can also take up glucose and use it as a source of carbon and energy, despite the fact that this compound is devoid of limiting elements and can also be synthesized by using standard metabolic pathways. This review will outline the main findings suggesting mixotrophy in the marine picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, and its ecological relevance for these important primary producers.},

These three genes are crucial to               Synechocystis               , in agreement with the proposed invention of glutathione by ancient cyanobacteria to protect themselves against the toxicity of oxygen they produced through photosynthesis. Consistent with their indispensability,               gshA               and               gshB               also operate in the production of another antioxidant, ergothioneine, as well as of the glutathione analogues ophthalmate and norophthalmate. Furthermore, we show that glutathione, ophthalmate and norophthalmate are accumulated in cells stressed by glucose, and that the two glutathione-dependent glyoxalase enzymes operate in the protection against glucose and its catabolite methylglyoxal. These findings are interesting because ophthalmate and norophthalmate were observed only in mammals so far, where ophthalmate is regarded as a biomarker of glutathione depletion. Instead, our data suggest that ophthalmate and norophthalmate are stress-induced markers of cysteine depletion triggered by its accelerated incorporation into glutathione, to face its increased demand for detoxification purposes. Hence,               Synechocystis               is an attractive model for the analysis of the role of glutathione, ergothioneine, ophthalmate and norophthalmate, in signalling and detoxification of oxidants and metabolic by-products.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sinking particulate organic carbon out of the surface ocean sequesters carbon on decadal to millennial timescales. Predicting the particulate carbon flux is therefore critical for understanding both global carbon cycling and the future climate. Microbes play a crucial role in particulate organic carbon degradation, but the impact of depth-dependent microbial dynamics on ocean-scale particulate carbon fluxes is poorly understood. Here we scale-up essential features of particle-associated microbial dynamics to understand the large-scale vertical carbon flux in the ocean. Our model provides mechanistic insight into the microbial contribution to the particulate organic carbon flux profile. We show that the enhanced transfer of carbon to depth can result from populations struggling to establish colonies on sinking particles due to diffusive nutrient loss, cell detachment, and mortality. These dynamics are controlled by the interaction between multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Accurately capturing particle-microbe interactions is essential for predicting variability in large-scale carbon cycling.},

In fall 2010, local maxima in abundance were observed in cyclones. We hypothesized surface Ekman transport convergence as a mechanism for trapping buoyant colonies in cyclones. Idealized models supported the potential of this process to influence the distribution of buoyant colonies over time scales of several months. In spring 2011, the highest vertically integrated colony abundances were observed in anticyclones. These peaks in abundance correlated with anomalously fresh water, suggesting riverine input as a driver of the relationship.

Current understanding is that carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by phytoplankton that are eaten, and in turn their predators die and sink into deep water and seafloor sediments. In addition to this route, Omand               et al.               show that downwelling caused by ocean eddies 1 to 10 km across can deliver much of the carbon produced in spring to the deep sea.

Autonomous observations made by gliders during the North Atlantic spring bloom reveal anomalous features at depths of 100 to 350 meters with elevated POC, chlorophyll, oxygen, and temperature-salinity characteristics of surface water. High-resolution modeling reveals that during the spring transition, intrusions of POC-rich surface water descend as coherent, 1- to 10-kilometer--scale filamentous features, often along the perimeter of eddies. Such a submesoscale eddy-driven flux of POC is unresolved in global carbon cycle models but can contribute as much as half of the total springtime export of POC from the highly productive subpolar oceans.},

Marine organisms must accumulate compatible solutes in their cells, counteracting the high exterior osmotic pressure. However,               Trichodesmium               does not possess any known genes for the synthesis of compatible solutes, making its proliferation in the high-salinity environment enigmatic. We demonstrate that               Trichodesmium               cultures in the laboratory as well as natural populations in the ocean synthesize homoserine betaine, previously unknown as a compatible solute, and elucidated the biosynthetic pathway. The high intracellular concentrations will lead to a major injection of this organic compound into the oligotrophic ocean, when natural               Trichodesmium               blooms lyse. Such sudden releases of homoserine betaine could impact the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen.                        ,                             The oceanic N               2               -fixing cyanobacterium               Trichodesmium               spp. form extensive surface blooms and contribute significantly to marine carbon and nitrogen cycles in the oligotrophic subtropical and tropical oceans.               Trichodesmium               grows in salinities from 27 to 43 parts per thousand (ppt), yet its salt acclimation strategy remains enigmatic because the genome of               Trichodesmium erythraeum               strain IMS101 lacks all genes for the biosynthesis of any known compatible solute. Using NMR and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy, we identified the main compatible solute in               T. erythraeum               strain IMS101 as the quaternary ammonium compound               N               ,               N               ,               N               -trimethyl homoserine (or homoserine betaine) and elucidated its biosynthetic pathway.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Every year, large numbers of zooplankton migrate from the surface ocean to depths of 500--2000\,m to hibernate. Through this migration, they actively transport organic carbon to the deep ocean, where it is used to fuel metabolic needs. This active transport of carbon is thought to be highly efficient, as carbon metabolized by copepods is directly injected deep into the ocean's interior. The significance of this process in view of global carbon cycling remains an open question. Here, we focus on five representative, diapausing copepod species (               Calanus finmarchicus               ,               Calanus hyperboreus               ,               Calanoides acutus               ,               Calanoides natalis               , and               Neocalanus tonsus               ) distributed in the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans. For each species, we compute both carbon injection (how much carbon is transported below the euphotic zone during zooplankton migration and left there as dissolved inorganic carbon) and carbon sequestration (the amount of carbon stored in the ocean's interior following diapausing zooplankton-mediated injection). In total, the five species considered here contribute 0.4--0.8\% of total biological carbon export, and 0.8--3.3\% of total carbon sequestration mediated by the biological pump (assuming a total carbon export of {\textasciitilde}\,10~PgC\,yr               -1               and sequestration of {\textasciitilde}\,1300\,PgC). Including other species in this inventory would increase the contribution of diapausing copepods to the biological carbon pump, but requires more precise estimates of copepods' distribution, abundance, and metabolic requirements.},

  abstract = {LC--MS-based untargeted metabolomics is heavily dependent on algorithms for automated peak detection and data preprocessing due to the complexity and size of the raw data generated. These algorithms are generally designed to be as inclusive as possible in order to minimize the number of missed peaks. This is known to result in an abundance of false positive peaks that further complicate downstream data processing and analysis. As a consequence, considerable effort is spent identifying features of interest that might represent peak detection artifacts. Here, we present the CPC algorithm, which allows automated characterization of detected peaks with subsequent filtering of low quality peaks using quality criteria familiar to analytical chemists. We provide a thorough description of the methods in addition to applying the algorithms to authentic metabolomics data. In the example presented, the algorithm removed about 35\% of the peaks detected by XCMS, a majority of which exhibited a low signal-to-noise ratio. The algorithm is made available as an R-package and can be fully integrated into a standard XCMS workflow.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE               Data analysis is a key step in mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics, starting with the generation of generic peak lists from raw liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) data. Due to the use of various algorithms by different workflows, the results of different peak-picking strategies often differ widely.                                         METHODS               Raw LC/HRMS data from two types of biological samples (bile and urine), as well as a standard mixture of 84 metabolites, were processed with four peak-picking softwares: Peakview{\textregistered}, Markerview™, MetabolitePilot™ and XCMS Online. The overlaps between the results of each peak-generating method were then investigated. To gauge the relevance of peak lists, a database search using the METLIN online database was performed to determine which features had accurate masses matching known metabolites as well as a secondary filtering based on MS/MS spectral matching.                                         RESULTS               In this study, only a small proportion of all peaks (less than 10\%) were common to all four software programs. Comparison of database searching results showed peaks found uniquely by one workflow have less chance of being found in the METLIN metabolomics database and are even less likely to be confirmed by MS/MS.                                         CONCLUSIONS               It was shown that the performance of peak-generating workflows has a direct impact on untargeted metabolomics results. As it was demonstrated that the peaks found in more than one peak detection workflow have higher potential to be identified by accurate mass as well as MS/MS spectrum matching, it is suggested to use the overlap of different peak-picking workflows as preliminary peak lists for more rugged statistical analysis in global metabolomics investigations.

LC-MS instrumentation and analysis conditions can differ substantially among laboratories and experiments, thus resulting in non-standardized datasets demanding customized annotation workflows. We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered around the MetaboCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation and CompoundDb packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation can be performed based on MS1 properties such as m/z and retention times, followed by an MS2-based annotation in which experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference library. Such reference databases can be created and managed with the CompoundDb package. The ecosystem supports data from a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, MSP, MGF, mzML, mzXML, netCDF as well as MassBank text files and SQL databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted LC-MS-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly unit-tested and documented and are available on GitHub and through Bioconductor.},

A major challenge is to evaluate the contribution of these physical pumps at small spatial and temporal scales ({$<$}100~km and {$<$}1~month). Here, we use a submesoscale permitting biophysical model covering a large domain representative of a subpolar and a subtropical gyre to quantify the impact of small-scale physical carbon pumps.The model successfully simulates intense eddy-driven subduction hot spots with a magnitude comparable to what has been observed in nature (1,000--6,000~mg~C{$\cdot$}m               -2               {$\cdot$}day               -1               ). These eddy-driven subduction events are able to transfer carbon below the mixed-layer, down to 500- to 1,000-m depth. However, they contribute {$<$}5\% to the annual flux at the scale of the basin, due to strong compensation between upward and downward fluxes. The model also simulates hot spots of export associated with small-scale heterogeneity of the mixed layer, which intermittently export large amounts of suspended particulate and dissolved organic carbon. The mixed-layer pump contributes {$\sim$}20\% to the annual flux. High-resolution measurements of export flux are needed to test models such as this one and to improve our mechanistic understanding of the biological pump and how it will respond to climate change.                        ,              Key Points                                                                A high-resolution model simulates realistic hot spots of organic carbon export by physical subduction                                                     Eddy-driven subduction contributes little to annual export due to compensation between upward and downward fluxes                                                     Eddy-driven spatiotemporal variations in the mixed-layer efficiently export dissolved and particulate organic carbon},

The efficiency of the biological pump is influenced by the size and taxonomic composition of the phytoplankton community. Large, heavily ballasted taxa such as diatoms sink quickly and thus efficiently remove fixed carbon from the upper ocean. Smaller, nonballasted species such as picoplanktonic cyanobacteria are usually thought to contribute little to export production. Research in the past decade, however, has shed new light on the potential importance of small phytoplankton to carbon export, especially in oligotrophic oceans, where small cells dominate primary productivity. Here, I examine the mechanisms and pathways through which small-phytoplankton carbon is exported from the surface ocean and the role of small phytoplankton in food webs of a variety of ocean ecosystems.},

By sampling over scales ranging from daily to approximately monthly over 2.25\,years, we evaluated the resilience of the picoeukaryotic community to seasonal- to episodic-scale physical disturbances, such as convective mixing and mesoscale processes, respectively. We quantified the frequency and intensity of disturbances that altered upper ocean light and nutrients in the context of the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program climatology, and evaluated picoeukaryotic community resilience based on shifts in dissimilarity in community structure at different depths in the euphotic zone. Our results suggest that in this stratified habitat, picoeukaryote communities are resilient on timescales of days to weeks in response to these physical disturbances, and that the juxtaposition of mesoscale and submesoscale disturbances on more predictable seasonality requires spatially and temporally resolved assessment of community response and resilience. We highlight the value of examining recent (days to weeks) physical forcing of the upper ocean for insight into the influences of physical habitat alterations that structure the contemporaneous plankton community.},

However, the study of dissolved polar metabolites in seawater and other environmental matrices has been hampered by analytical challenges including high inorganic ion concentrations, low analyte concentrations, and high chemical diversity. Here we show that a cation-exchange solid-phase extraction (CX-SPE) sample preparation approach separates positively charged and zwitterionic metabolites from seawater and freshwater samples, allowing their analysis by liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry. We successfully extracted 69 known compounds from an in-house compound collection and evaluated the performance of the method by establishing extraction efficiencies (EEs) and limits of detection (pM to low nM range) for these compounds. CX-SPE extracted a range of compounds including amino acids and compatible solutes, resulted in very low matrix effects, and performed robustly across large variations in salinity and dissolved organic matter concentration. We compared CX-SPE to an established SPE procedure (PPL-SPE) and demonstrate that these two methods extract fundamentally different fractions of the dissolved metabolite pool with CX-SPE extracting compounds that are on average smaller and more polar. We use CX-SPE to analyze four environmental samples from distinct aquatic biomes, producing some of the first CX-SPE dissolved metabolomes. Quantified compounds ranged in concentration from 0.0093 to 49\,nM and were composed primarily of amino acids (0.15--16\,nM) and compatible solutes such as trimethylamine N-oxide (0.89--49\,nM) and glycine betaine (2.8--5.2~nM).},

Using recently available genomic data combined with culture-based surveys of vitamin auxotrophy (i.e., vitamin requirements), we show that this auxotrophy is widespread in the marine environment and occurs in both autotrophs and heterotrophs residing in oligotrophic and eutrophic environments. Our analysis shows that vitamins originate from the activities of some bacteria and algae and that taxonomic changes observed in marine phytoplankton communities could be the result of their specific vitamin requirements and/or vitamin availability. Dissolved vitamin concentration measurements show that large areas of the world ocean are devoid of B vitamins, suggesting that vitamin limitation could be important for the efficiency of carbon and nitrogen fixation in those regions.},

While various spectrum-spectrum match scores exist, the field lacks statistical methods for estimating the false discovery rates (FDR) of these annotations. We present empirical Bayes and target-decoy based methods to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR) for 70 public metabolomics data sets. We show that the spectral matching settings need to be adjusted for each project. By adjusting the scoring parameters and thresholds, the number of annotations rose, on average, by +139\% (ranging from -92 up to +5705\%) when compared with a default parameter set available at GNPS. The FDR estimation methods presented will enable a user to assess the scoring criteria for large scale analysis of mass spectrometry based metabolomics data that has been essential in the advancement of proteomics, transcriptomics, and genomics science.},

Our aims were to find the ammonia-producing pathway of arginine catabolism in               E. coli               and to examine its function. We showed that the only previously described pathway of arginine catabolism, which does not produce ammonia, accounted for only 3\% of the arginine consumed. A search for another arginine catabolic pathway led to discovery of the ammonia-producing arginine succinyltransferase (AST) pathway in               E. coli               . Nitrogen limitation induced this pathway in both               E. coli               and               Klebsiella aerogenes               , but the mechanisms of activation clearly differed in these two organisms. We identified the               E. coli               gene for succinylornithine aminotransferase, the third enzyme of the AST pathway, which appears to be the first of an               astCADBE               operon. Its disruption prevented arginine catabolism, impaired ornithine utilization, and affected the synthesis of all the enzymes of the AST pathway. Disruption of               astB               eliminated succinylarginine dihydrolase activity and prevented arginine utilization but did not impair ornithine catabolism. Overproduction of AST enzymes resulted in faster growth with arginine and aspartate. We conclude that the AST pathway is necessary for aerobic arginine catabolism in               E. coli               and that at least one enzyme of this pathway contributes to ornithine catabolism.},

Two main explanations have been proposed. The first attributes the N:P variability to changes in the community composition of well-adapted phytoplankton. The second proposes that variability arises from physiological acclimation involving intracellular adjustments of nutrient allocation under nutrient deficiency. Using a model of phytoplankton physiology, observational datasets, and a review of laboratory culture results, we assess the mechanistic basis of N:P variability. We find that the taxonomic composition of well-adapted phytoplankton best explains observed variations in POM N:P. Furthermore, we show that acclimation to nutrient deficiency may be safely neglected when considering the effects of ecology on POM N:P. These findings provide insight into the controls on global variability in POM composition and average phytoplankton physiological performance in the oceans.},

Differential preferences for specific N substrates may be important in controlling phytoplankton community composition. To date, there is limited information on how specific N substrates influence the composition of naturally occurring microbial communities. We investigated the effect of nitrate (                              ), ammonium (                              ), and urea on microbial and phytoplankton community composition (cell abundances and 16S rRNA gene profiling) and functioning (photosynthetic activity, carbon fixation rates) in the oligotrophic waters of the North Pacific Ocean. All N substrates tested significantly stimulated phytoplankton growth and productivity.

Two abundant clades of               Prochlorococcus               , High Light I and II, demonstrated similar responses to urea, suggesting this substrate is likely an important N source for natural               Prochlorococcus               populations. In contrast, the heterotrophic community composition changed most in response to                              . Finally, the time and magnitude of response to N amendments varied with geographic location, likely due to differences in microbial community composition and their nutrient status. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that changes in N supply would likely favor specific populations of phytoplankton in different oceanic regions and thus, affect both biogeochemical cycles and ecological processes.},

This downward transport of organic matter sequesters carbon dioxide from exchange with the atmosphere on timescales of months to millennia, depending on where in the water column the respiration occurs. There are three primary export pathways that link the upper ocean to the interior: the gravitational, migrant, and mixing pumps. These pathways are regulated by vastly different mechanisms, making it challenging to quantify the impacts of the biological pump on the global carbon cycle. In this review, we assess progress toward creating a global accounting of carbon export and sequestration via the biological pump and suggest a path toward achieving this goal.},

Using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, fluxomics, and flux balance analysis to examine short-term shifts in nitrogen utilization in the model pennate diatom in               Phaeodactylum tricornutum               , we obtained a systems-level understanding of assimilation and intracellular distribution of nitrogen. Chloroplasts and mitochondria are energetically integrated at the critical intersection of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in diatoms. Pathways involved in this integration are organelle-localized GS-GOGAT cycles, aspartate and alanine systems for amino moiety exchange, and a split-organelle arginine biosynthesis pathway that clarifies the role of the diatom urea cycle. This unique configuration allows diatoms to efficiently adjust to changing nitrogen status, conferring an ecological advantage over other phytoplankton taxa.},

A critical role of these adaptations is to achieve a proper balance between structural rigidity, which is necessary for maintaining three-dimensional conformation, and flexibility, which is required to allow changes in conformation during function. The Goldilocks principle refers to this balancing act, wherein structural stability and functional properties are poised at values that are just right for the environment the organism faces. Achieving this balance involves changes in macromolecular sequence and adaptive change in the composition of the aqueous or lipid milieu in which macromolecules function. This article traces the development of the field of biochemical adaptation throughout my career and shows how comparative studies of marine animals from diverse habitats have shed light on fundamental properties of life common to all organisms.},

With this increased productivity, the coastal shelves of the Arctic Ocean may act as a sink for atmospheric carbon. However, this storage is dependent on a sufficient nitrogen (N) supply and current literature on biogeochemical rates of N uptake in this region is severely limited. Here, we report the spatial extent and rate at which the aquatic microbial community utilizes inorganic and organic N substrates in the Alaskan Arctic during late summer. Uptake rates ({$>$}\,0.3\,               {$\mu$}               m) were measured in 2016 and 2017 using isotopically labeled ammonium (), nitrate (), urea, and mixed algal amino acids. Rates of  regeneration were also measured to investigate the contribution of remineralized N to primary production. Primary production was estimated using isotopically labeled bicarbonate. We found that N species uptake varied by location. Although  was the form of N taken up at the greatest rate at most sites, we also found that uptake rates of urea could be greater than  and that amino acid uptake was widespread. Supporting previous studies,  uptake rates were correlated with primary production rates. Variability in nutrient reservoirs and sampling conditions in the Chukchi Sea between the 2 yr were responsible for some of the variances observed in estimated  recycling rates and primary production. Understanding which N sources support this late-season primary production requires obtaining uptake rates for a diverse range of inorganic and organic N substrates.},

Bacteria and zooplankton solubilize and consume POC to support their metabolism, but the relative importance of bacteria vs. zooplankton in the consumption of sinking particles in the twilight zone is unknown. We compared losses of sinking POC, using differences in export flux measured by neutrally buoyant sediment traps at a range of depths, with bacteria and zooplankton metabolic requirements at the Hawaii Ocean Time-series station ALOHA in the subtropical Pacific and the Japanese times-series site K2 in the subarctic Pacific. Integrated (150-1,000 m) mesopelagic bacterial C demand exceeded that of zooplankton by up to 3-fold at ALOHA, while bacteria and zooplankton required relatively equal amounts of POC at K2. However, sinking POC flux was inadequate to meet metabolic demands at either site. Mesopelagic bacterial C demand was 3- to 4-fold (ALOHA), and 10-fold (K2) greater than the loss of sinking POC flux, while zooplankton C demand was 1- to 2-fold (ALOHA), and 3- to 9-fold (K2) greater (using our `middle' estimate conversion factors to calculate C demand). Assuming the particle flux estimates are accurate, we posit that this additional C demand must be met by diel vertical migration of zooplankton feeding at the surface and by carnivory at depth{\^A}---with both processes ultimately supplying organic C to mesopelagic bacteria. These pathways need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models that predict global C sequestration in the deep sea.},

However, due to their episodic and patchy nature, salp blooms often go undetected and are rarely included in measurements or models of the BCP. We quantified salp-mediated export processes in the northeast subarctic Pacific Ocean in summer of 2018 during a bloom of               Salpa aspera               . Salps migrated from 300 to 750~m during the day into the upper 100~m at night. Salp fecal pellet production comprised up to 82\% of the particulate organic carbon (POC) produced as fecal pellets by the entire epipelagic zooplankton community. Rapid sinking velocities of salp pellets (400--1,200~m~d               -1               ) and low microbial respiration rates on pellets ({$<$}1\% of pellet C respired day               -1               ) led to high salp pellet POC export from the euphotic zone-up to 48\% of total sinking POC across the 100~m depth horizon. Salp active transport of carbon by diel vertical migration and carbon export from sinking salp carcasses was usually {$<$}10\% of the total sinking POC flux. Salp-mediated export markedly increased BCP efficiency, increasing by 1.5-fold the proportion of net primary production exported as POC across the base of the euphotic zone and by 2.6-fold the proportion of this POC flux persisting 100~m below the euphotic zone. Salps have unique and important effects on ocean biogeochemistry and, especially in low flux settings, can dramatically increase BCP efficiency and thus carbon sequestration.                        ,              Key Points                                                                High salp abundances combined with unique features of salp ecology and physiology lead to their outsized role in the biological pump                                                     During a summer salp bloom in the northeast Pacific Ocean, salp-mediated carbon export increased the amount and efficiency of carbon export                                                     Salps, especially in otherwise low flux settings, can increase carbon sequestration in the ocean},

However, mechanisms that control this carbon export remain poorly constrained, limiting our ability to model and predict future changes in this globally important process. We show that the flux of sinking particles (typically considered the dominant form of downward transport of organic carbon) is twice as high at a frontal system, relative to surrounding waters or to nonfrontal conditions. Furthermore, downward transport by subduction leads to additional carbon export at the front that is similar in magnitude to the sinking flux. Such enhanced C export at episodic and mesoscale features needs to be incorporated into biogeochemical forecast models.                        ,                             Enhanced vertical carbon transport (gravitational sinking and subduction) at mesoscale ocean fronts may explain the demonstrated imbalance of new production and sinking particle export in coastal upwelling ecosystems. Based on flux assessments from               238               U:               234               Th disequilibrium and sediment traps, we found 2 to 3 times higher rates of gravitational particle export near a deep-water front (305 mg C{$\cdot$}m               -2               {$\cdot$}d               -1               ) compared with adjacent water or to mean (nonfrontal) regional conditions. Elevated particle flux at the front was mechanistically linked to Fe-stressed diatoms and high mesozooplankton fecal pellet production. Using a data assimilative regional ocean model fit to measured conditions, we estimate that an additional {$\sim$}225 mg C{$\cdot$}m               -2               {$\cdot$}d               -1               was exported as subduction of particle-rich water at the front, highlighting a transport mechanism that is not captured by sediment traps and is poorly quantified by most models and in situ measurements. Mesoscale fronts may be responsible for over a quarter of total organic carbon sequestration in the California Current and other coastal upwelling ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic microbes are the predominant sources of organic carbon in the sunlit regions of the ocean. During photosynthesis, nitrogen and carbon metabolism are coordinated to synthesize nitrogen-containing organics such as amino acids and nucleic acids. In large regions of the ocean, nitrogen is thought to limit the growth of phytoplankton. The impact of nitrogen limitation on the synthesis of organic carbon is not well understood, especially for the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the nitrogen-limited regions of the ocean,               Prochlorococcus               . This study compares the carbon metabolism of nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited               Prochlorococcus               spp. to determine how nitrogen availability influences inorganic carbon assimilation into an organic form. Metabolomics and physiological data revealed that cells under nitrogen limitation have reduced metabolic flux and total carbon fixation rates while maintaining elevated metabolite pool levels and releasing a larger proportion of total fixed carbon to the environment.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Primary production by               Prochlorococcus               , the smallest known free-living photosynthetic organism in terms of both physical and genomic size, is thought to have a significant role in global carbon cycles. Despite its small size and low growth rate,               Prochlorococcus               numerically dominates the phytoplankton community in the nutrient-poor oligotrophic ocean, the largest biome of the Earth's surface. How nutrient limitation, and nitrogen limitation in particular, affects the fate and flux of carbon fixed by               Prochlorococcus               is currently unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we compared the bulk rates of photosynthesis and organic carbon release, the concentrations of intracellular metabolites, and the rates of assimilated carbon into the metabolite pools between replete and N-limited chemostat cultures. Total photosynthesis of our N-limited cultures was less than half of those observed in replete cultures, and nitrogen limitation also appears to cause a larger proportion of total fixed carbon to be released to the environment. Our data suggest this occurs in concert with the maintenance of large slow-moving pools of metabolites, including nitrogen-rich molecules such as glutamate. Additionally, we report field data suggesting metabolisms of               Prochlorococcus               are comparable to results we observe in our laboratory studies. Accounting for these observations, potential metabolic mechanisms utilized by               Prochlorococcus               are discussed as we build upon our understanding of nutrient-limited photosynthesis and carbon metabolism.                                         IMPORTANCE               Photosynthetic microbes are the predominant sources of organic carbon in the sunlit regions of the ocean. During photosynthesis, nitrogen and carbon metabolism are coordinated to synthesize nitrogen-containing organics such as amino acids and nucleic acids. In large regions of the ocean, nitrogen is thought to limit the growth of phytoplankton. The impact of nitrogen limitation on the synthesis of organic carbon is not well understood, especially for the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the nitrogen-limited regions of the ocean,               Prochlorococcus               . This study compares the carbon metabolism of nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-limited               Prochlorococcus               spp. to determine how nitrogen availability influences inorganic carbon assimilation into an organic form. Metabolomics and physiological data revealed that cells under nitrogen limitation have reduced metabolic flux and total carbon fixation rates while maintaining elevated metabolite pool levels and releasing a larger proportion of total fixed carbon to the environment.},

Teeling                 et al.                              (p.               608               ) used a combination of microscopy, metagenomics, and metaproteomics to analyze samples from a North Sea diatom bloom over time. Distinct steps of polysaccharide degradation and carbohydrate uptake could be assigned to clades of Flavobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which differ profoundly in their transporter profiles and their uptake systems for phosphorus. The phytoplankton/bacterioplankton coupling in coastal marine systems is of crucial importance for global carbon cycling. Bacterioplankton clade succession following phytoplankton blooms may be predictable enough that it can be included in models of global carbon cycling.                        ,              Seasonal diatom growth in the North Sea results in a temporal succession of metabolically specialized bacteria.           ,                             Phytoplankton blooms characterize temperate ocean margin zones in spring. We investigated the bacterioplankton response to a diatom bloom in the North Sea and observed a dynamic succession of populations at genus-level resolution. Taxonomically distinct expressions of carbohydrate-active enzymes (transporters; in particular, TonB-dependent transporters) and phosphate acquisition strategies were found, indicating that distinct populations of               Bacteroidetes               ,               Gammaproteobacteria               , and               Alphaproteobacteria               are specialized for successive decomposition of algal-derived organic matter. Our results suggest that algal substrate availability provided a series of ecological niches in which specialized populations could bloom. This reveals how planktonic species, despite their seemingly homogeneous habitat, can evade extinction by direct competition.},

In response, the community has developed the open mzML format, implemented in XML and based on controlled vocabularies. Widely adopted, mzML is an important step forward; however, it suffers from two challenges that are particularly apparent as the field moves to high-throughput proteomics: large increase in file size, and a largely sequential I/O access pattern. Described here is `toffee', an open, random I/O format backed by HDF5, with lossless compression that gives file sizes similar~to the original vendor format and can be reconverted back to mzML without penalty. It is shown that mzML and toffee are equivalent when processing data using OpenSWATH algorithms, in additional to novel applications that are enabled by new data access patterns. For instance, a peptide-centric deep-learning pipeline for peptide identification is proposed. Documentation and examples are available at               https://toffee.readthedocs.io               , and all code is MIT licensed at               https://bitbucket.org/cmriprocan/toffee               .},

  abstract = {Abstract Advancements in mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation---including higher resolution, faster scan speeds, increased throughput, and improved sensitivity---along with the growing adoption of imaging and ion mobility, have dramatically increased the volume and complexity of data produced in fields like proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. While these technologies unlock new possibilities, they also present significant challenges in data management, storage, and accessibility. Existing formats, such as the XML-based community standards mzML and imzML, struggle to meet the demands of modern MS workflows due to their large file sizes, slow data access, and limited metadata support. Vendor-specific formats, while optimized for proprietary instruments, lack interoperability, comprehensive metadata support and long-term archival reliability. This white paper lays the groundwork for mzPeak, a next-generation data format designed to address these challenges and support high-throughput, multi-dimensional MS workflows. By adopting a hybrid model that combines efficient binary storage for numerical data and human-readable metadata storage, mzPeak will reduce file sizes, accelerate data access, and offer a scalable, adaptable solution for evolving MS technologies. For researchers, mzPeak will enable faster (random) data access, enhanced interoperability across platforms, and seamless support for complex workflows, including ion mobility and imaging. Its design will ensure data is managed in compliance with regulatory standards, essential for applications such as precision medicine and chemical safety, where long-term data integrity and accessibility are critical. For vendors, mzPeak provides a streamlined, open alternative to proprietary formats, reducing the burden of regulatory compliance while aligning with the industry's push for transparency and standardization. By offering a high-performance, interoperable solution, mzPeak positions vendors to meet customer demands for sustainable data management tools which will be able to handle emerging and future data types and workflows. mzPeak aspires to become the cornerstone of MS data management, empowering researchers, vendors, and developers to innovate and collaborate more effectively. We invite the MS community to join the discussion on PREreview.org and collaborate in developing and adopting mzPeak to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.},

Bacterial genes for which expression decreased between the beginning and end of the incubation and chemical formulae that were depleted over this same time frame were used as indicators of bioavailable compounds, an approach that avoids augmenting or modifying the natural DOM pool. Transport- and metabolism-related genes whose relative expression decreased implicated osmolytes, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, sugars and organic sulfur compounds as candidate bioreactive molecules. FT-ICR MS analysis of depleted molecular formulae implicated functional groups {\textasciitilde} 30--40 Da in size cleaved from semi-polar components of DOM as bioreactive components. Both gene expression and FT-ICR MS analyses indicated higher lability of compounds with sulfur and nitrogen heteroatoms. Untargeted methodologies able to integrate biological and chemical perspectives can be effective strategies for characterizing the labile microbial metabolites participating in carbon flux.},

MAAs show great diversity in their molecular structures, which exhibit a range of molecular weights spanning 188 to 1050 Daltons. MAAs are utilized in a wide variety of organisms including prokaryotes and eukaryotic micro-organisms that inhabit aquatic, terrestrial, and marine environments. These features suggest that MAAs are stable and fundamental molecules that allow these organisms to live under UV irradiation. MAAs are thought to have been greatly important to ancient forms of life on Earth, functioning as a primary sunscreen to reduce  short-wavelength light. Structurally different MAAs might have been developed in  MAA-producing organisms during their environmental adaptation. Harmful irradiation directly damages biomolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA, and induces oxidative stress through radical-propagating processes. Thus, MAAs are expected to play an additional role in the antioxidant system. This review focuses on MAAs with radical scavenging activities. To cover all the reported MAAs known thus far, we surveyed the CAS database and have summarized the structures and the chemical and physical properties of these MAAs, including their antioxidant activities.},

Most research on compression algorithms rarely provides flexible random file reading scheme.~Database-developed solution guarantees the efficiency of random file reading, but nevertheless the efforts in compression and third-party software support are insufficient. Under the premise of ensuring the efficiency of decompression, we propose an encoding scheme ``Stack-ZDPD'' that is optimized for storage of raw MS data, designed for the format ``Aird'', a computation-oriented format with fast accessing and decoding time, where the core compression algorithm is ``ZDPD''. Stack-ZDPD reduces the volume of data stored in mzML format by around 80\% or more, depending on the data acquisition pattern, and the compression ratio is approximately 30\% compared to ZDPD for data generated using Time of Flight technology. Our approach is available on AirdPro, for file conversion and the Java-API Aird-SDK, for data parsing.},

However, current observation-based estimates disagree on the strength of this biological carbon pump (BCP)               2               . Earth system models (ESMs) also exhibit a large spread of BCP estimates, indicating limited representations of the known carbon export pathways               3               . Here we use several decades of hydrographic observations to produce a top-down estimate of the strength of the BCP with an inverse biogeochemical model that implicitly accounts for all known export pathways. Our estimate of total organic carbon (TOC) export at 73.4\,m (model euphotic zone depth) is 15.00\,{\textpm}\,1.12\,Pg\,C\,year               -1               , with only two-thirds reaching 100\,m depth owing to rapid remineralization of organic matter in the upper water column.

Nevertheless, export of organic carbon by mixing and other fluid transport of dissolved matter and suspended particles remains regionally important for meeting the respiratory carbon demand. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the sequestration efficiency inferred from our inversion suggests that future global warming may intensify the recycling of organic matter in the upper ocean, potentially weakening the BCP.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The marine nitrogen (N) cycle is a complex network of biological transformations in different N pools. The linkages among these different reservoirs are often poorly understood. Traditional methods for measuring N uptake rely on bulk community properties and cannot provide taxonomic information.               15               N-based stable isotope probing (SIP), however, is a technique that allows detection of uptake of individual N sources by specific microorganisms. In this study we used               15               N SIP methodology to assess the use of different nitrogen substrates by               Synechococcus               spp. and diatoms on the west Florida shelf. Seawater was incubated in the presence of               15               N-labeled ammonium, nitrate, urea, glutamic acid, and a mixture of 16 amino acids. DNA was extracted and fractionated using CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify the amounts of               Synechococcus               and diatom DNA as a function of density, and               15               N tracer techniques were used to measure rates of N uptake by the microbial community. The ammonium, nitrate, urea, and dissolved primary amine uptake rates were 0.077, 0.065, 0.013, and 0.055 {$\mu$}mol N liter               -1               h               -1               , respectively. SIP data indicated that diatoms and               Synechococcus               spp. actively incorporated N from [               15               N]nitrate, [               15               N]ammonium, and [               15               N]urea.               Synechococcus               also incorporated nitrogen from [               15               N]glutamate and               15               N-amino acids, but no evidence indicating uptake of labeled amino acids by diatoms was detected. These data suggest that N flow in communities containing               Synechococcus               spp. and diatoms has more plasticity than the new-versus-recycled production paradigm suggests and that these phytoplankters should not be viewed strictly as recycled and new producers, respectively.},

We conclude that the in vitro observations, implying net heterotrophy, must contain a bias that is due to an underestimate of photosynthetic rate and/or an overestimate of respiration rate.},

Wilson               et al.               set sail to sample the plume, deploying subsea gliders and using satellite monitoring to measure the dynamics of this rare event in the nutrient-poor Pacific (see the Perspective by Ducklow and Plank). They found subsurface chlorophyll maxima not visible by remote sensing, performed transcriptome and N isotope marker analysis, and measured nutrients, partitioning of biomass into different organisms, and primary production. Much of the data are corroborated by physical modeling of the ocean dynamics. The authors conclude that the plume was fed by the lava heating subsurface water and triggering upwelling of deepwater nutrients to the surface rather than by direct injection of micronutrients from lava.

The lava-impacted seawater was characterized by high concentrations of metals and nutrients that stimulated phytoplankton growth, resulting in an extensive plume of chlorophyll a that was detectable by satellite. Chemical and molecular evidence revealed that this biological response hinged on unexpectedly high concentrations of nitrate, despite the negligible quantities of nitrogen in basaltic lava. We hypothesize that the high nitrate was caused by buoyant plumes of nutrient-rich deep waters created by the substantial input of lava into the ocean. This large-scale ocean fertilization was therefore a unique perturbation event that revealed how marine ecosystems respond to exogenous inputs of nutrients.},

Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB's search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB's ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.},

They are ubiquitous, abundant, and often neglected by science. Worden               et al.               review the challenges of understanding the role protists play in geochemical cycling in the oceans. These organisms can photosynthesize like plants, graze on bacteria and archaea, parasitize each other and bigger creatures, have sex, and sometimes do all these things serially as conditions change. Their activities may have a significant influence on carbon cycling, and research efforts need to be amplified to understand their functional importance in marine ecosystems.                                         Science               , this issue               10.1126/science.1257594                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Marine ecosystems are composed of a diverse array of life forms, the majority of which are unicellular---archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. The power of these microbes to process carbon, shape Earth's atmosphere, and fuel marine food webs has been established over the past 40 years. The marine biosphere is responsible for approximately half of global primary production, rivaling that of land plants. Unicellular eukaryotes (protists) are major contributors to this ocean productivity. In addition to photosynthetic growth, protists exhibit a range of other trophic modes, including predation, mixotrophy (a combination of photosynthetic and predatory-based nutrition), parasitism, symbiosis, osmotrophy, and saprotrophy (wherein extracellular enzymes break down organic matter to smaller compounds that are then transported into the cell by osmotrophy).                                         ADVANCES               Sensitive field approaches have illuminated the enormous diversity of protistan life (much of it uncultured) and, coupled with activity measurements, are leading to hypotheses about their ecological roles. In parallel, large-scale sequencing projects are providing fundamental advances in knowledge of genome/gene composition, especially among photosynthetic lineages, many of which are complex amalgams derived from multiple endosymbiotic mergers. Marine protists have yielded insight into basic biology, evolution, and molecular machineries that control organismal responses to the environment. These studies reveal tightly controlled signaling and transcriptional regulation as well as responses to limitation of resources such as iron, nitrogen, and vitamins, and offer understanding of animal and plant evolution. With the formulation of better computational approaches, hypotheses about interactions and trophic exchanges are becoming more exact and modelers more assertive at integrating different data types. At the same time, the impacts of climate change are being reported in multiple systems, of which polar environments are the touchstone of change.                                         OUTLOOK               Driven by the need to translate the biology of cells into processes at global scales, researchers must bring the conceptual framework of systems biology into bigger ``ecosystems biology'' models that broadly capture the geochemical activities of interacting plankton networks. Existing data show that protists are major components of marine food webs, but deducing and quantifying their ecosystem linkages and the resulting influences on carbon cycling is difficult. Genome-based functional predictions are complicated by the importance of cellular structures and flexible behaviors in protists, which are inherently more difficult to infer than the biochemical pathways typically studied in prokaryotes. Alongside the plethora of genes of unknown function, manipulable genetic systems are rare for marine protists. The development of genetic systems and gene editing for diverse, ecologically important lineages, as well as innovative tools for preserving microbe-microbe interactions during sampling, for visual observation, and for quantifying biogeochemical transformations, are critical but attainable goals. These must be implemented in both field work and laboratory physiology studies that examine multiple environmental factors. Expanding genome functional predictions to identify the molecular underpinnings of protistan trophic modes and realistically constrain metabolism will position the field to build reliable cell systems biology models and link these to field studies. By factoring in true complexities, we can capture key elements of protistan interactions for assimilation into more predictive global carbon cycle models.                                                   Global biogeochemical and ecological models rely on understanding organismal biology and the interactions occurring in marine microbial food webs.                   Protists have multifarious roles from the sunlit surface ocean to leagues below. Understanding of protistan behaviors and adaptability lags far behind knowledge of evolutionary processes that have shaped their genomes. As such, microbial mediation of carbon fluxes and specific interactions remain ill-resolved and predictive capabilities are still weak. Strategies to narrow this gap involve iteration between experimental and observational field studies, controlled laboratory experiments, systems biology approaches that preserve cellular structures and behaviors using relevant model taxa, and computational approaches.                                                                         ,              The profound influence of marine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires---a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences. We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.},

Polyhydric alcohols, free amino acids and their derivatives, and combinations of urea and methylamines are the three types of osmolyte systems found in all water-stressed organisms except the halobacteria. The selective advantages of the organic osmolyte systems are, first, a compatibility with macromolecular structure and function at high or variable (or both) osmolyte concentrations, and, second, greatly reduced needs for modifying proteins to function in concentrated intracellular solutions. Osmolyte compatibility is proposed to result from the absence of osmolyte interactions with substrates and cofactors, and the nonperturbing or favorable effects of osmolytes on macromolecular-solvent interactions.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Organic osmolytes are small solutes used by cells of numerous water-stressed organisms and tissues to maintain cell volume. Similar compounds are accumulated by some organisms in anhydrobiotic, thermal and possibly pressure stresses. These solutes are amino acids and derivatives,polyols and sugars, methylamines, methylsulfonium compounds and urea. Except for urea, they are often called `compatible solutes', a term indicating lack of perturbing effects on cellular macromolecules and implying interchangeability. However, these features may not always exist, for three reasons. First, some of these solutes may have unique protective metabolic roles, such as acting as antioxidants (e.g. polyols, taurine, hypotaurine),providing redox balance (e.g. glycerol) and detoxifying sulfide (hypotaurine in animals at hydrothermal vents and seeps). Second, some of these solutes stabilize macromolecules and counteract perturbants in non-interchangeable ways. Methylamines [e.g. trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] can enhance protein folding and ligand binding and counteract perturbations by urea (e.g. in elasmobranchs and mammalian kidney), inorganic ions, and hydrostatic pressure in deep-sea animals. Trehalose and proline in overwintering insects stabilize membranes at subzero temperatures. Trehalose in insects and yeast,and anionic polyols in microorganisms around hydrothermal vents, can protect proteins from denaturation by high temperatures. Third, stabilizing solutes appear to be used in nature only to counteract perturbants of macromolecules,perhaps because stabilization is detrimental in the absence of perturbation. Some of these solutes have applications in biotechnology, agriculture and medicine, including in vitro rescue of the misfolded protein of cystic fibrosis. However, caution is warranted if high levels cause overstabilization of proteins.},

This asks to retrieve from an MS dataset some selected peaks in a data window whose image in a display window reflects the visual feature of all peaks in the data window. If an algorithm for this purpose is asked to output high-quality solutions in real time, then the most fundamental dependence of it is on the storage format of the MS dataset.                                         Results               We present mzMD, a new storage format of MS datasets and an algorithm to query this format of a storage system for a summary (a set of selected representative peaks) of a given data window. We propose a criterion Q-score to examine the quality of data window summaries. Experimental statistics on real MS datasets verified the high speed of mzMD in retrieving high-quality data window summaries. mzMD reported summaries of data windows whose Q-score outperforms those mzTree reported. The query speed of mzMD is the same as that of mzTree whereas its query speed stability is better than that of mzTree.

However, the range of compounds used and the distribution of organic compound uptake genes within picocyanobacteria are unknown. Here we analyze genomic and metagenomic data from around the world to determine the extent and distribution of mixotrophy in these phototrophs. Analysis of 49 Prochlorococcus and 18 Synechococcus isolate genomes reveals that all have the transporters necessary to take up amino acids, peptides and sugars. However, the number and type of transporters and associated catabolic genes differ between different phylogenetic groups, with low-light IV Prochlorococcus, and 5.1B, 5.2 and 5.3 Synechococcus strains having the largest number. Metagenomic data from 68 stations from the Tara Oceans expedition indicate that the genetic potential for mixotrophy in picocyanobacteria is globally distributed and differs between clades. Phylogenetic analyses indicate gradual organic nutrient transporter gene loss from the low-light IV to the high-light II Prochlorococcus. The phylogenetic differences in genetic capacity for mixotrophy, combined with the ubiquity of picocyanobacterial organic compound uptake genes suggests that mixotrophy has a more central role in picocyanobacterial ecology than was previously thought.},

  abstract = {Significance             Organic matter in the global ocean, soils, and sediments stores about five times more carbon than the atmosphere. Thus, the controls on the accumulation of organic matter are critical to global carbon cycling. However, we lack a quantitative understanding of these controls. This prevents meaningful descriptions of organic matter cycling in global climate models, which are required for understanding how changes in organic matter reservoirs provide feedbacks to past and present changes in climate. Currently, explanations for organic matter accumulation remain under debate, characterized by seemingly competing hypotheses. Here, we develop a quantitative framework for organic matter accumulation that unifies these hypotheses. The framework derives from the ecological dynamics of microorganisms, the dominant consumers of organic matter.           ,              Organic matter constitutes a key reservoir in global elemental cycles. However, our understanding of the dynamics of organic matter and its accumulation remains incomplete. Seemingly disparate hypotheses have been proposed to explain organic matter accumulation: the slow degradation of intrinsically recalcitrant substrates, the depletion to concentrations that inhibit microbial consumption, and a dependency on the consumption capabilities of nearby microbial populations. Here, using a mechanistic model, we develop a theoretical framework that explains how organic matter predictably accumulates in natural environments due to biochemical, ecological, and environmental factors. Our framework subsumes the previous hypotheses. Changes in the microbial community or the environment can move a class of organic matter from a state of functional recalcitrance to a state of depletion by microbial consumers. The model explains the vertical profile of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean and connects microbial activity at subannual timescales to organic matter turnover at millennial timescales. The threshold behavior of the model implies that organic matter accumulation may respond nonlinearly to changes in temperature and other factors, providing hypotheses for the observed correlations between organic carbon reservoirs and temperature in past earth climates.},

We have shown that the first radio-labeled product of assimilation of               13               NH               4               +               (t               1/2               = 10 min) was glutamine in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana (Hustedt). When GS-GOGAT was inhibited with methionine sulfoximine, the incorporation of radioactivity into both glutamine and glutamate was blocked, implying that the radio-labeled glutamate is formed from glutamine. Glutamine was also the first labeled product when the intracellular concentration of ammonium was elevated by preincubation with unlabeled ammonium. The results indicate that the GS-GOGAT pathway is the primary pathway for the assimilation of nitrogen in T. pseudonana.},

In ammonium-limited continuous cultures, growing at rates from 0.2 to 3.2 d-1, no trend in uptake rates per cell was apparent, but the rate of incorporation of radiolabeled ammonium into trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble material, following a saturating pulse of ammonium, was linearly correlated with growth rate (r2 = 0.93). Calculated growth rates overestimated the measured rates. The ratio of calculated growth requirements ({$\mu$}Q) to growth requirements based on incorporation of 13N into TCA-insoluble material ({\textmu}q) was nonlinearly related to growth rate. The discrepancy between {\textmu}Q and {\textmu}q was explained by isotope dilution in the internal free amino acid pool. The ratio of uptake to incorporation, corrected for isotope dilution in the amino acid pool, showed that uptake and growth were uncoupled at low growth rates but were coupled at {\textmu}max. The ratio of short-term uptake to incorporation was found to be a direct measure of enhanced uptake and decreased with increasing growth rate. This ratio may be a useful parameter for determining growth rates and nitrogen deficiency in natural phytoplankton communities.},
